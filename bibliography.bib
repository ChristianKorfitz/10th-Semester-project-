abstract = { Abstract—In recent years, low-cost, low-power myoelectric control systems such as the Myo armband from Thalmic Labs have become available and unlocked tremendous possibilities for myoelectric controlled applications. However, due to the embedded system constraints, such sEMG control devices typically samples sEMG signals at a lower frequency. It is in doubt whether existing sEMG feature extraction methods are still valid on such low-resolution sEMG data. In addition, the feature extraction algorithms implemented on embedded devices must have low computational complexity in order to meet the real-time requirement. This paper aims to investigate effective features for low-resolution EMG pattern recognition. In particular, a set of novel computational efficient space-domain (SD) features (referred to as simple SD (SSD) features) have been developed to exploit the spatial relationships of sEMG signals recorded from the sensor array on the Myo armband. The proposed SSD feature set was evaluated with a linear discriminant analysis (LDA)-based classifier on a 9-gesture dataset. The experimental results indicate that using the SSD features increased the classification accuracy by 5{\%} compared to using Hudgins' time-domain features.},

abstract = {Closed-loop control is important for amputees to manipulate myoelectric prostheses intuitively and dexterously. Tactile feedback can help amputees improve myoelectric control performance for grasping objects. To investigate the effects of different tactile feedback, we performed experiments on six amputees and six able-bodied subjects via electrotactile stimulation. Using a virtual environment, six kinds of objects with different weights and stiffnesses were used for grasping tasks. Five feedback conditions (no feedback, pressure feedback, slip feedback, pressure+slip feedback, and vision feedback) were considered. Nine evaluation indexes and three control objectives (rapidity, economy, and stability) were proposed. Under the five feedback conditions, our study investigated four issues: 1) three types of grasping-related failures; 2) four types of grasping-related time measures; 3) average grasping force; 4) standard deviation of the grasping force. Results indicate that: 1) slip feedback is better than pressure feedback; 2) pressure+slip feedback can improve grasping rapidity; 3) slip feedback significantly contributes to grasping economy and stability; and 4) pressure+slip feedback can perform as well as vision feedback.},

abstract = {This review presents an analytical and comparative survey of upper limb prosthesis acceptance and abandonment as documented over the past 25 years, detailing areas of consumer dissatisfaction and ongoing technological advancements. English-language articles were identified in a search of Ovid, PubMed, and ISI Web of Science (1980 until February 2006) for key words upper limb and prosthesis. Articles focused on upper limb prostheses and addressing: (i) Factors associated with abandonment; (ii) Rejection rates; (iii) Functional analyses and patterns of wear; and (iv) Consumer satisfaction, were extracted with the exclusion of those detailing tools for outcome measurement, case studies, and medical procedures. Approximately 200 articles were included in the review process with 40 providing rates of prosthesis rejection. Quantitative measures of population characteristics, study methodology, and prostheses in use were extracted from each article. Mean rejection rates of 45{\%} and 35{\%} were observed in the literature for body-powered and electric prostheses respectively in pediatric populations. Significantly lower rates of rejection for both body-powered (26{\%}) and electric (23{\%}) devices were observed in adult populations while the average incidence of non-wear was similar for pediatric (16{\%}) and adult (20{\%}) populations. Documented rates of rejection exhibit a wide range of variance, possibly due to the heterogeneous samples involved and methodological differences between studies. Future research should comprise of controlled, multifactor studies adopting standardized outcome measures in order to promote comprehensive understanding of the factors affecting prosthesis use and abandonment. An enhanced understanding of these factors is needed to optimize prescription practices, guide design efforts, and satiate demand for evidence-based measures of intervention.},

abstract = {User acceptance of myoelectric forearm prostheses is currently low. Awkward control, lack of feedback, and difficult training are cited as primary reasons. Recently, researchers have focused on exploiting the new possibilities offered by advancements in prosthetic technology. Alternatively, researchers could focus on prosthesis acceptance by developing functional requirements based on activities users are likely to perform. In this article, we describe the process of determining such requirements and then the application of these requirements to evaluating the state of the art in myoelectric forearm prosthesis research. As part of a needs assessment, a workshop was organized involving clinicians (representing end users), academics, and engineers. The resulting needs included an increased number of functions, lower reaction and execution times, and intuitiveness of both control and feedback systems. Reviewing the state of the art of research in the main prosthetic subsystems (electromyographic [EMG] sensing, control, and feedback) showed that modern research prototypes only partly fulfill the requirements. We found that focus should be on validating EMG-sensing results with patients, improving simultaneous control of wrist movements and grasps, deriving optimal parameters for force and position feedback, and taking into account the psychophysical aspects of feedback, such as intensity perception and spatial acuity.},

abstract = {User feedback about grasping force or slip of objects is lacking in current myoelectric forearm prostheses, resulting in a high number of prosthesis abandonment, because a high level of concentration is required to hold an object. Several approaches to provide force feedback to the user via vibrotactile stimulation have been described in literature, but none of them have investigated the optimal stimulation parameters. This study describes an evaluation of three modulation techniques to provide force feedback. Furthermore, the same modulation techniques to provide slip feedback were evaluated, which has not been described before. The performance in virtual object holding tasks was significantly improved in most cases compared to the non-feedback situation, but at the cost of an increased task duration.},

abstract = {An anthropomorphic underactuated prosthetic hand, endowed with position and force sensors and controlled by means of myoelectric commands, is used to perform experiments of hierarchical shared control. Three different hierarchical control strategies combined with a vibrotactile feedback system have been developed and tested by able-bodied subjects through grasping tasks used in activities of daily living (ADLs). The first goal is to find a good tradeoff between good grasping capabilities and low attention required by the user to complete grasping tasks, without addressing advanced algorithm for electromyographic processing. The second goal is to understand whether a vibrotactile feedback system is subjectively or objectively useful and how it changes users' performance. Experiments showed that users were able to successfully operate the device in the three control strategies, and that the grasp success increased with more interactive control. Practice has proven that when too much effort is required, subjects do not do their best, preferring, instead, a less-interactive control strategy. Moreover, the experiments showed that when grasping tasks are performed under visual control, the enhanced proprioception offered by a vibrotactile system is practically not exploited. Nevertheless, in subjective opinion, feedback seems to be quite important.},

abstract = {The development of a new generation of hand prostheses that can ideally approximate the human 'physiological' performance in terms of movement dexterity and sensory feedback for amputees still poses many open research challenges. The most promising approaches aim at establishing a direct connection with either the central or the peripheral human nervous system by means of invasive or non-invasive neural interfaces. This paper starts from the assumption that a major contribution to derive functional and technical specifications for such interfaces, and even for the whole prosthetic system, can stem from in-depth analysis of the nervous system reorganization following limb amputation. Neuroplasticity can be modulated by the use of hand prostheses both in the acute phase and in the long-term. We hereby critically review the literature concerning neuroplastic phenomena in amputees, in terms of changes at different CNS levels, particularly for their implications on the development of bidirectional neural interfaces for cybernetic hand prostheses. Our analysis of the literature demonstrates that: (1) the level of CNS reorganization could be used as a parameter of the effectiveness achieved by the prosthetic device and its interfaces, in restoring the hand physiological functionality, (2) the prosthetic system could be seen as a neurorehabilitation tool, as it could induce reduction in aberrant plasticity and promote 'good' plasticity and (3) new generations of 'natural' interfaces can be developed by fully exploiting neuroplastic phenomena to restore neural connections originally governing the lost limb and linking them to the prosthetic system. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The typical control of myoelectric interfaces, whether in laboratory settings or real-life prosthetic applications, largely relies on visual feedback because proprioceptive signals from the controlling muscles are either not available or very noisy. We conducted a set of experiments to test whether artificial proprioceptive feedback, delivered non-invasively to another limb, can improve control of a two-dimensional myoelectrically-controlled computer interface. In these experiments, participants' were required to reach a target with a visual cursor that was controlled by electromyogram signals recorded from muscles of the left hand, while they were provided with an additional proprioceptive feedback on their right arm by moving it with a robotic manipulandum. Provision of additional artificial proprioceptive feedback improved the angular accuracy of their movements when compared to using visual feedback alone but did not increase the overall accuracy quantified with the average distance between the cursor and the target. The advantages conferred by proprioception were present only when the proprioceptive feedback had similar orientation to the visual feedback in the task space and not when it was mirrored, demonstrating the importance of congruency in feedback modalities for multi-sensory integration. Our results reveal the ability of the human motor system to learn new inter-limb sensory-motor associations; the motor system can utilize task-related sensory feedback, even when it is available on a limb distinct from the one being actuated. In addition, the proposed task structure provides a flexible test paradigm by which the effectiveness of various sensory feedback and multi-sensory integration for myoelectric prosthesis control can be evaluated.},

abstract = {To effectively replace the human hand, a prosthesis should seamlessly respond to user intentions but also convey sensory information back to the user. Restoration of sensory feedback is rated highly by the prosthesis users, and feedback is critical for grasping in able-bodied subjects. Nonetheless, the benefits of feedback in prosthetics are still debated. The lack of consensus is likely due to the complex nature of sensory feedback during prosthesis control, so that its effectiveness depends on multiple factors (e.g., task complexity, user learning). We evaluated the impact of these factors with a longitudinal assessment in six amputee subjects, using a clinical setup (socket, embedded control) and a range of tasks (box and blocks, block turn, clothespin and cups relocation). To provide feedback, we have proposed a novel vibrotactile stimulation scheme capable of transmitting multiple variables from a multifunction prosthesis. The subjects wore a bracelet with four by two uniformly placed vibro-tactors providing information on contact, prosthesis state (active function), and grasping force. The subjects also completed a questionnaire for the subjective evaluation of the feedback. The tests demonstrated that feedback was beneficial only in the complex tasks (block turn, clothespin and cups relocation), and that the training had an important, task-dependent impact. In the clothespin relocation and block turn tasks, training allowed the subjects to establish successful feedforward control, and therefore, the feedback became redundant. In the cups relocation task, however, the subjects needed some training to learn how to properly exploit the feedback. The subjective evaluation of the feedback was consistently positive, regardless of the objective benefits. These results underline the multifaceted nature of closed-loop prosthesis control as, depending on the context, the same feedback interface can have different impact on performance. Finally, even if the closed-loop control does not improve the performance, it could be beneficial as it seems to improve the subjective experience. Therefore, in this study we demonstrate, for the first time, the relevance of an advanced, multi-variable feedback interface for dexterous, multi-functional prosthesis control in a clinically relevant setting.},

abstract = {This study describes a novel myoelectric control scheme that is capable of motion rejection. As an extension of the commonly used linear discriminant analysis (LDA), this system generates a confidence score for each decision, providing the ability to reject those with a score below a selected threshold. The thresholds are class-specific and affect only the rejection characteristics of the associated class. Furthermore, because the rejection stage is implemented using the outputs of the LDA, the active motion classification accuracy of the proposed system is shown to outperform that of the LDA for all values of rejection threshold. The proposed scheme was compared to a baseline LDA-based pattern recognition system using a real-time Fitts' law-based target acquisition task. The use of velocity-based myoelectric control using the rejection classifier is shown to obey Fitts' law, producing linear regression fittings with high coefficients of determination (R(2) {\textgreater} 0.943).

abstract = {Objective. The aim of the present work was to develop and test a flexible electrotactile stimulation system to provide real-time feedback to the prosthesis user. The system requirements were to accommodate the capabilities of advanced multi-DOF myoelectric hand prostheses and transmit the feedback variables (proprioception and force) using intuitive coding, with high resolution and after minimal training. Approach. We developed a fully-programmable and integrated electrotactile interface supporting time and space distributed stimulation over custom designed flexible array electrodes. The system implements low-level access to individual stimulation channels as well as a set of high-level mapping functions translating the state of a multi-DoF prosthesis (aperture, grasping force, wrist rotation) into a set of predefined dynamic stimulation profiles. The system was evaluated using discrimination tests employing spatial and frequency coding (10 able-bodied subjects) and dynamic patterns (10 able-bodied and 6 amputee subjects). The outcome measure was the success rate (SR) in discrimination. Main results. The more practical electrode with the common anode configuration performed similarly to the more usual concentric arrangement. The subjects could discriminate six spatial and four frequency levels with SR {\textgreater}90{\%} after a few minutes of training, whereas the performance significantly deteriorated for more levels. The dynamic patterns were intuitive for the subjects, although amputees showed lower SR than able-bodied individuals (86{\%} 10{\%} versus 99{\%} 3{\%}). Significance. The tests demonstrated that the system was easy to setup and apply. The design and resolution of the multipad electrode was evaluated. Importantly, the novel dynamic patterns, which were successfully tested, can be superimposed to transmit multiple feedback variables intuitively and simultaneously. This is especially relevant for closing the loop in modern multifunction prostheses. Therefore, the proposed system is convenient for practical applications and can be used to implement sensory perception training and/or closed-loop control of myoelectric prostheses, providing grasping force and proprioceptive feedback.},

The scheme described within uses pattern recognition to process four channels of MES, with the task of discriminating multiple classes of limb movement. The method does not require segmentation of the MES data, allowing a continuous stream of class decisions to be delivered to a prosthetic device. It is shown in this paper that, by exploiting the processing power inherent in current computing systems, substantial gains in classifier accuracy and response time are possible. Other important characteristics for prosthetic control systems are met as well. Due to the fact that the classifier learns the muscle activation patterns for each desired class for each individual, a natural control actuation results. The continuous decision stream allows complex sequences of manipulation involving multiple joints to be performed without interruption. Finally, minimal storage capacity is required, which is an important factor in embedded control systems.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The need of a sensory feedback system that would improve users' acceptance in prostheses is generally recognized. Feedback of hand opening and position are among the most important concerns of prosthetic users. To address the two concerns, this study investigated the human capability to identify pulse number and location when electrical stimulation applied on the forearm skin. The pulse number may potentially be used to encode the opening of prosthetic hands and stimulation location to encode finger position.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Ten able-bodied subjects participated in the study. Three electrodes were placed transversely across the ventral forearm spatially encoding three fingers (i.e., thumb, index, and middle finger). Five different pulse numbers (1, 4, 8, 12, and 20) encoded five levels of hand opening. The study consisted of three experiments. In the three experiments, each after a training session, the subjects were required to identify among: (a) five stimulation locations, (b) five pulse numbers, or (c) ten paired combinations of location and pulse number, respectively. The subjects' performance in the three identification tasks was evaluated.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The main results included: 1) the overall identification rate for stimulation location was 92.2 ± 6.2{\%}, while the success rate in two-site stimulation was lower than one-site stimulation; 2) the overall identification rate for pulse number was 90.8 ± 6.0{\%}, and the subjects showed different performance in identification of the five pulse numbers; 3) the overall identification rate decreased to 80.2 ± 11.7{\%} when the subjects were identifying paired parameters.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that the spatial (location) and temporal (pulse number) identification performance are promising in electrocutaneous stimulation on the forearm. The performance degraded when both parameters had to be identified likely due to increased cognitive load resulting from multiple tasks. Utilizing the proposed coding strategy in practical prosthetic hands remains to be investigated for clinical evaluation of its feasibility.},

abstract = {This paper presents two methods for the classification of six different hand motions based on the analysis of the transient state of surface multichannel electromyographic signals recorded from 10 normally limbed subjects. The signals were classified using the coefficients extracted from a discrete wavelet transform analysis. While the first method uses a feature vector based on the variance of the wavelet coefficients, the second analysis considers a PCA treatment focused on dimensionality reduction. These vectors were used to feed an artificial neural network. The first method was applied for both the transient and steady states obtaining an average classification accuracy of 89.43{\%} (SD 2.05{\%}) and 91.86{\%} (SD 3.17{\%}) respectively. The second method gave a classification accuracy of 92.58{\%} (SD 3.07{\%}) for the transient state. This proves the existence of deterministic information within the transient state of the EMG signal and the possibility to classify different movements since the beginning of the muscle contraction.},

A force-matching grasping task is used to quantify performance improvements at three different force levels with a pulsing vibrotactile feedback channel to convey grasping force. Results show that the haptic feedback led to improved performance in an experienced subgroup of subjects while naive subjects showed no improvement.

Several different techniques can be employed to provide amputees with sensory feedback: sensory substitution methods where the recorded stimulus is not only transferred to the amputee, but also translated to a different modality (modality-matched feedback), which transfers the stimulus without translation and direct neural stimulation, which interacts directly with peripheral afferent nerves. This paper presents an overview of the principal works and devices employed to provide upper limb amputees with sensory feedback. The focus is on sensory substitution and modality matched feedback; the principal features, advantages and disadvantages of the different methods are presented.},

abstract = {Introduction: The needs of individuals with upper limb amputation and congenital limb difference are not being fully met by current prostheses, evidenced by prosthesis rejection, non-wear, and reports of pain and challenging activities. Emerging technologies such as electrical stimulation for the restoration of sensation, implantable neural interfaces for improved prosthetic control, and dexterous sensorized robotic limbs have the potential to provide novel benefits, but pose additional risks. Prosthesis user perspectives on such benefits and risks can inform device development, clinical trial design, and regulatory benefit-risk assessments. Methods: In preparation for a survey of prosthesis user perspectives on relevant benefits and risks, we conducted pilot interviews with seven individuals with upper limb amputation or congenital limb difference. Interviews included questions about participants' typical daily experiences. Particular attention was paid to challenging activities or situations in which limitations were encountered. When limitations were relevant to novel prosthetic technologies, participants were asked about their perspectives on these technologies. Interviews were recorded and transcribed for content analysis and text mining. Results: Pain on the intact side and the side with amputation or limb difference was mentioned frequently. Precise control of hand or finger movements was also important, both during activities of daily living (ADLs) and when using computers or handheld electronics. Common desires for new technologies were lighter-weight devices, more comfortable device attachment, and more functionality for ADLs. Text mining confirmed the importance of using prosthesis to execute "small tasks," comfort of the myoelectric socket, and playing with children. Conclusion: The qualitative data collected in this study can be used to generate hypotheses to test in a planned survey. The most consistent theme was pain due to overuse syndrome, which resulted in concerns about current and future impact on quality of life and ability to work. Therefore, some risks may be acceptable to some prosthesis users to obtain a prosthesis with dexterous function, control, fluidity of use, and operation speed. Another consistent theme was the value to participants of feeling "whole," functionally, cosmetically or in interpersonal relationships. Future survey questions may therefore probe the value of sensory feedback in the context of a naturalfeeling limb or body schema. A more complete understanding of how novel technologies could address real user needs may inform implementation of new technologies and regulatory decision-making. (Figure Presented) .},

abstract = {In closed loop control of grasping by hand prostheses, the feedback information sent to the user is usually the actual controlled variable, i.e., the grasp force. Although this choice is intuitive and logical, the force production is only the last step in the process of grasping. Therefore, this study evaluated the performance in controlling grasp strength using a hand prosthesis operated through a complete grasping sequence while varying the feedback variables (e.g., closing velocity, grasping force), which were provided to the user visually or through vibrotactile stimulation. The experiments were conducted on 13 volunteers who controlled the Otto Bock Sensor HandTM Speed prosthesis. Results showed that vibrotactile patterns were able to replace the visual feedback. Interestingly, the experiments demonstrated that direct force feedback was not essential for the control of grasping force. The subjects were indeed able to control the grip strength, predictively, by estimating the grasping force from the prosthesis velocity of closing. Therefore, grasping without explicit force feedback is not completely blind, contrary to what is usually assumed. In our study we analyzed grasping with a specific prosthetic device, but the outcomes are also applicable for other devices, with one or more degrees-of-freedom. The necessary condition is that the EMG directly and proportionally controls the velocity/grasp force of the hand, which is a common approach among EMG controlled prosthetic devices. The results provide important indications on the design of closed loop EMG controlled prosthetic systems.},

This control strategy is significantly altered in those with upper limb amputation as sensations of touch and movement are inherently lost.

Numerous sensory feedback systems have been proposed in literature to address this gap in prosthetic control; however, these systems have yet to be implemented for long term use.

The psychometric tests confirmed that the subjects could perceive and interpret the electrotactile feedback with a high success rate. The subjects performed the routine grasping task comprising 4 blocks of 60 grasping trials. In each trial, the subjects employed feedforward control to close the hand and produce the desired grasping force (four levels). First (baseline) and the last (validation) session were performed in open loop, while the second and the third session (training) included electrotactile feedback. The obtained results confirmed that using the feedback improved the accuracy and precision of the force control. In addition, the subjects performed significantly better in the validation vs. baseline session, therefore suggesting that electrotactile feedback can be used for learning and training of myoelectric control.},

abstract = {Background: Pattern recognition (PR) based strategies for the control of myoelectric upper limb prostheses are generally evaluated through offline classification accuracy, which is an admittedly useful metric, but insufficient to discuss functional performance in real time. Existing functional tests are extensive to set up and most fail to provide a challenging, objective framework to assess the strategy performance in real time. Methods. Nine able-bodied and two amputee subjects gave informed consent and participated in the local Institutional Review Board approved study. We designed a two-dimensional target acquisition task, based on the principles of Fitts' law for human motor control. Subjects were prompted to steer a cursor from the screen center of into a series of subsequently appearing targets of different difficulties. Three cursor control systems were tested, corresponding to three electromyography-based prosthetic control strategies: 1) amplitude-based direct control (the clinical standard of care), 2) sequential PR control, and 3) simultaneous PR control, allowing for a concurrent activation of two degrees of freedom (DOF). We computed throughput (bits/second), path efficiency ({\%}), reaction time (second), and overshoot ({\%})) and used general linear models to assess significant differences between the strategies for each metric. Results: We validated the proposed methodology by achieving very high coefficients of determination for Fitts' law. Both PR strategies significantly outperformed direct control in two-DOF targets and were more intuitive to operate. In one-DOF targets, the simultaneous approach was the least precise. The direct control was efficient in one-DOF targets but cumbersome to operate in two-DOF targets through a switch-depended sequential cursor control. Conclusions: We designed a test, capable of comprehensively describing prosthetic control strategies in real time. When implemented on control subjects, the test was able to capture statistically significant differences (p {\textless} 0.05) in control strategies when considering throughputs, path efficiencies and reaction times. Of particular note, we found statistically significant (p {\textless} 0.01) improvements in throughputs and path efficiencies with simultaneous PR when compared to direct control or sequential PR. Amputees could readily achieve the task; however a limited number of subjects was tested and a statistical analysis was not performed with that population. {\textcopyright} 2014 Wurth and Hargrove; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A drawback of active prostheses is that they detach the subject from the produced forces, thereby preventing direct mechanical feedback. This can be compensated by providing somatosensory feedback to the user through mechanical or electrical stimulation, which in turn may improve the utility, sense of embodiment, and thereby increase the acceptance rate.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAPPROACH: In this study, we compared a novel approach to closing the loop, namely EMG feedback (emgFB), to classic force feedback (forceFB), using electrotactile interface in a realistic task setup. Eleven intact-bodied subjects and one transradial amputee performed a routine grasping task while receiving emgFB or forceFB. The two feedback types were delivered through the same electrotactile interface, using a mixed spatial/frequency coding to transmit 8 discrete levels of the feedback variable. In emgFB, the stimulation transmitted the amplitude of the processed myoelectric signal generated by the subject (prosthesis input), and in forceFB the generated grasping force (prosthesis output). The task comprised 150 trials of routine grasping at six forces, randomly presented in blocks of five trials (same force). Interquartile range and changes in the absolute error (AE) distribution (magnitude and dispersion) with respect to the target level were used to assess precision and overall performance, respectively.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN RESULTS: Relative to forceFB, emgFB significantly improved the precision of myoelectric commands (min/max of the significant levels) for 23{\%}/36{\%} as well as the precision of force control for 12{\%}/32{\%}, in intact-bodied subjects. Also, the magnitude and dispersion of the AE distribution were reduced. The results were similar in the amputee, showing considerable improvements.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSIGNIFICANCE: Using emgFB, the subjects therefore decreased the uncertainty of the forward pathway. Since there is a correspondence between the EMG and force, where the former anticipates the latter, the emgFB allowed for predictive control, as the subjects used the feedback to adjust the desired force even before the prosthesis contacted the object. In conclusion, the online emgFB was superior to the classic forceFB in realistic conditions that included electrotactile stimulation, limited feedback resolution (8 levels), cognitive processing delay, and time constraints (fast grasping).},

abstract = {Without the sense of touch, amputees with prosthetic hands can have difficulty holding and manipulating objects, especially when a task requires some degree of skill and tactile feedback to perform. To equip prosthetic hand users with touch sensing and tactile feedback, researchers have been experimenting with various types of force and/or tactile sensors together with various methods for delivering the tactile information to the brain. Although some success has been achieved recently with force sensors and implanted electrodes, these systems are expensive, surgically invasive and can represent an infection risk where cables emerge through the skin. Also, non-invasive tactile feedback methods involving temperature, vibrations or electro-mechanical force feedbacks, can be somewhat awkward and ineffective due to being cumbersome or unable to deliver appropriate sensations. To address some of these issues we have been developing an electro-tactile feedback system for prosthetic hands. Our proposed system is comprised of force sensors that can be placed almost anywhere on a prosthetic hand, and TENS electrodes that can be placed on the wearer's arm. Our system is inexpensive, multi-channel and easily fitted to existing prosthetic hands. Experimental results are provided that show how this form of tactile feedback can enable a user to feel various objects touched or gripped with a robotic humanoid hand. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2011.},

abstract = {The recent introduction of novel multifunction hands as well as new control paradigms increase the demand for advanced prosthetic control systems. In this context, an unambiguous terminology and a good understanding of the nature of the control problem is important for efficient research and communication concerning the subject. Thus, one purpose of this paper is to suggest an unambiguous taxonomy, applicable to control systems for upper limb prostheses and also to prostheses in general. A functionally partitioned model of the prosthesis control problem is also presented along with the taxonomy. In the second half of the paper, the suggested taxonomy has been exploited in a comprehensive literature review on proportional myoelectric control of upper limb prostheses. The review revealed that the methods for system training have not matured at the same pace as the novel multifunction prostheses and more advanced intent interpretation methods. Few publications exist regarding the choice of training method and the composition of the training data set. In this context, the notion of outcome measures is essential. By definition, system training involves optimization, and the quality of the results depends heavily on the choice of appropriate optimization criteria. In order to further promote the development of proportional myoelectric control, these topics need to be addressed.},

abstract = {Any implant or prosthesis replacing a function or functions of an organ or group of organs should be biologically and sensorily integrated with the human body in order to increase their acceptance with their user. If this replacement is for a human hand, which is an important interface between humans and their environment, the acceptance issue and developing sensory-motor embodiment will be more challenging. Despite progress in prosthesis technologies, 50-60{\&}{\#}x0025; of hand amputees wear a prosthetic device. One primary reason for the rejection of the prosthetic hands is that there is no or negligibly small feedback or tactile sensation from the hand to the user, making the hands less functional. In fact, the loss of a hand means interrupting the closed-loop sensory feedback between the brain (motor control) and the hand (sensory feedback through the nerves). The lack of feedback requires significant cognitive efforts from the user in order to do basic gestures and daily activities. To this aim, recently, there has been significant development in the provision of sensory feedback from transradial prosthetic hands, to enable the user take part in the control loop and improve user embodiment. Sensory feedback to the hand users can be provided via invasive and noninvasive methods. The latter includes the use of temperature, vibration, mechanical pressure and skin stretching, electrotactile stimulation, phantom limb stimulation, audio feedback, and augmented reality. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the non-invasive methods, performs their critical evaluation, and presents challenges and opportunities associated with the non-invasive sensory feedback methods.},

abstract = {Feature extraction is a significant method to extract the useful information which is hidden in surface electromyography (EMG) signal and to remove the unwanted part and interferences. To be successful in classification of the EMG signal, selection of a feature vector ought to be carefully considered. However, numerous studies of the EMG signal classification have used a feature set that have contained a number of redundant features. In this study, most complete and up-to-date thirty-seven time domain and frequency domain features have been proposed to be studied their properties. The results, which were verified by scatter plot of features, statistical analysis and classifier, indicated that most time domain features are superfluity and redundancy. They can be grouped according to mathematical property and information into four main types: energy and complexity, frequency, prediction model, and time-dependence. On the other hand, all frequency domain features are calculated based on statistical parameters of EMG power spectral density. Its performance in class separability viewpoint is not suitable for EMG recognition system. Recommendation of features to avoid the usage of redundant features for classifier in EMG signal classification applications is also proposed in this study. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The ability to distinguish object stiffness is a very important aspect in object handling, but completely lacking in current myoelectric prostheses. In human hands both tactile and proprioceptive sensory information are required for stiffness determination. Therefore, it was investigated whether it is possible to distinguish object stiffness with vibrotactile feedback of hand opening and grasping force. Three configurations consisting of an array of coin motors and a single miniature vibrotactile transducer were investigated. Ten healthy subjects and seven subjects with upper limb loss due to amputation or congenital defects performed virtual grasping tasks, in which they controlled hand opening and grasping force. They were asked to determine the stiffness of a grasped virtual object from four options. With hand opening feedback alone or in combination with grasping force feedback, correct stiffness determination was achieved in around 60{\%} of the cases and significantly higher than the 25{\%} achieved without feedback or grasping force feedback alone. Despite the equal performance results, the combination of hand opening and grasping force feedback was preferred by the subjects over the hand opening feedback alone. No differences between feedback configurations and between subjects with upper limb loss and healthy subjects were found.},

Microelectrode arrays were implanted in the residual median and ulnar arm nerves, and intramuscular electromyography recording leads were implanted in residual limb muscles to enable sensory feedback and motor control. Objective measures (proprioceptive drift) and subjective measures (survey answers) were used to assess prosthesis embodiment. For both measures, there was a significant level of embodiment of the physical prosthetic limb after open-loop motor control of the prosthesis (i.e., without sensory feedback), open-loop sensation from the prosthesis (i.e., without motor control), and closed-loop control of the prosthesis (i.e., motor control with sensory feedback). There was also a statistically significant reduction in reported phantom pain after experimental sessions that included open-loop nerve microstimulation, open-loop prosthesis motor control, or closed-loop prosthesis motor control. The closed-loop condition provided no additional significant improvements in phantom pain reduction or prosthesis embodiment relative to the open-loop sensory condition or the open-loop motor condition.

abstract = {The functionality of upper limb prostheses can be improved by intuitive control strategies that use bioelectric signals measured at the stump level. One such strategy is the decoding of motor volition via myoelectric pattern recognition (MPR), which has shown promising results in controlled environments and more recently in clinical practice. Moreover, not much has been reported about daily life implementation and real-time accuracy of these decoding algorithms. This paper introduces an alternative approach in which MPR allows intuitive control of four different grips and open/close in a multifunctional prosthetic hand. We conducted a clinical proof-of-concept in activities of daily life by constructing a self-contained, MPR-controlled, transradial prosthetic system provided with a novel user interface meant to log errors during real-time operation. The system was used for five days by a unilateral dysmelia subject whose hand had never developed, and who nevertheless learned to generate patterns of myoelectric activity, reported as intuitive, for multi-functional prosthetic control. The subject was instructed to manually log errors when they occurred via the user interface mounted on the prosthesis. This allowed the collection of information about prosthesis usage and real-time classification accuracy. The assessment of capacity for myoelectric control test was used to compare the proposed approach to the conventional prosthetic control approach, direct control. Regarding the MPR approach, the subject reported a more intuitive control when selecting the different grips, but also a higher uncertainty during proportional continuous movements. This paper represents an alternative to the conventional use of MPR, and this alternative may be particularly suitable for a certain type of amputee patients. Moreover, it represents a further validation of MPR with dysmelia cases.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Authors. Technological advances in manufacturing smart high-performances electronic devices, increasingly available at lower costs, nowadays allow one to improve users' quality of life in many application fields. In this work, the human-machine interaction obtained by using a next generation device (Myo armband) is analyzed and discussed, with a particular focus to healthcare applications such as upper-limb prostheses. An overview on application fields of the Myo armband and on the latest research works related to its use in prosthetic applications is presented; subsequently, the technical features and functionalities of this device are examined. Myo armband is a wearable device provided with eight electromyographic electrodes, a 9-axes inertial measurement unit and a transmission module. It sends the data related to the detected signals, via Bluetooth Low Energy technology, to other electronic devices which process them and act accordingly, depending on how they are programmed (in order to drive actuators or perform other specific functions). Applied to the prosthetic field, Myo armband allows one to overcome many issues related to the existing prostheses, representing a complete electronic platform that detects in real-time the main signals related to forearm activity (muscles activation and forearm movements in the three-dimensional space) and sends these data to the connected devices. Nowadays, several typologies of prostheses are available on the market; they can be mainly distinguished into low-cost prostheses, which are light and compact but allow for a limited number of movements, and high-end prostheses, which are much more complex and featured by high dexterity, but also heavy, bulky, difficult to control and very expensive. Finally, the Myo armband is an optimum candidate for prosthetic application (and many others) and offers an excellent lowcost solution for obtaining a reliable, easy to use system.},

abstract = {Few studies are available in the literature on the sensations artificially created by dual-channel electrocutaneous stimulation. This study assessed the effect of a set of selected stimulation parameters on the sensations evoked by single- or dual-channel electrocutaneous stimulation. The investigated parameters included the stimulation site, the number of pulses, the number of stimulating channels (single- vs dual-channel), and the interleaved time between two channels. The modality, quality, location, and magnitude of the sensations were evaluated when the stimulations were applied on the forearm skin in 16 nondisabled subjects. Tactile perception was found to be induced more easily on the median and ulnar aspect than the dorsal and radial aspect of the forearm. Stimulation site significantly affected the magnitude of the sensation (p {\textless} 0.01). Dual-channel stimulation significantly increased the sensation magnitude (p {\textless} 0.05) only when the two electrodes were positioned closely. Moreover, a higher number of pulses evoked a movement perception more frequently and the interleaved time showed no significant effect on the magnitude of the sensation. The findings are expected to be useful for sensory substitution and augmentation applications. The results may also help improve users' acceptance of hand prostheses.},

abstract = {The present research moves in the direction of enabling a bidirectional communication between the subject brain and the prosthetic limb, by providing the prosthesis with an artificial cutaneous sensing through an electronic skin. In this preliminary study, the skin response to the applied mechanical stimuli is conveyed to the human subject using electrotactile stimulation. Experimental tests on two healthy subjects show that a short training through reinforced learning increased considerably the success rate in the identification of the impact location. This preliminary study demonstrates the feasibility of communicating the tactile information from the electronic skin to the human subject using multichannel electrocutaneous stimulation. The result is promising since it implies that it might be possible to achieve the embodiment of the artificial skin into the body scheme of the human subject, relying on the brain ability to successfully process the artificial tactile information.},

abstract = {Closing the control loop by providing somatosensory feedback to the user of a prosthesis is a well-known, long standing challenge in the field of prosthetics. Various approaches have been investigated for feedback restoration, ranging from direct neural stimulation to noninvasive sensory substitution methods. Although there are many studies presenting closed-loop systems, only a few of them objectively evaluated the closed-loop performance, mostly using vibrotactile stimulation. Importantly, the conclusions about the utility of the feedback were partly contradictory. The goal of the current study was to systematically investigate the capability of human subjects to control grasping force in closed loop using electrotactile feedback. We have developed a realistic experimental setup for virtual grasping, which operated in real time, included a set of real life objects, as well as a graphical and dynamical model of the prosthesis. We have used the setup to test 10 healthy, able bodied subjects to investigate the role of training, feedback and feedforward control, robustness of the closed loop, and the ability of the human subjects to generalize the control to previously “unseen” objects. Overall, the outcomes of this study are very optimistic with regard to the benefits of feedback and reveal various, practically relevant, aspects of closed-loop control.},

@article{Guanglin2010,
abstract = {We evaluated real-time myoelectric pattern recognition control of a virtual arm by transradial amputees. Five unilateral patients performed 10 wrist and hand movements using their amputated and intact arms. In order to demonstrate the value of information from intrinsic hand muscles, this data was included in EMG recordings from the intact arm. With both arms, motions were selected in approximately 0.2 s on average, and completed in less than 1.25 s. Approximately 99{\%} of wrist movements were completed using either arm; however, the completion rate of hand movements was significantly lower for the amputated arm (53.9{\%} {\^{A}}± 14.2{\%}) than for the intact arm ( 69.4{\%} {\^{A}}± 13.1{\%}). For the amputated arm, average classification accuracy for only 6 movements-including a single hand grasp-was 93.1{\%} {\^{A}}± 4.1{\%}, compared to 84.4{\%} {\^{A}}± 7.2{\%} for all 10 movements. Use of 6 optimally-placed electrodes only reduced this accuracy to 91.5{\%} {\^{A}}± 4.9{\%}. These results suggest that muscles in the residual forearm produce sufficient myoelectric information for real-time wrist control, but not for performing multiple hand grasps. The outcomes of this study could aid the development of a practical multifunctional myoelectric prosthesis for transradial amputees, and suggest that increased EMG information-such as made available through targeted muscle reinnervation-could improve control of these prostheses .},

@article{Hahne2014,
abstract = {—In recent years the number of active controllable joints in electrically powered hand-prostheses has increased significantly. However, the control strategies for these devices in current clinical use are inadequate as they require separate and sequential control of each degree of freedom (DoF). In this study we systematically compare linear and non-linear regression techniques for an independent, simultaneous and proportional myoelectric control of wrist movements with two DoF. These techniques include linear regression (LR), mixture of linear experts (ME), multilayer-perceptron (MLP) and kernel ridge regression (KRR). They are investigated offline with electro-myographic (EMG) signals acquired from ten able-bodied sub-jects and one person with congenital upper limb deficiency. The control accuracy is reported as a function of the number of electrodes and the amount and diversity of training data providing guidance for the requirements in clinical practice The results showed that KRR, a non-parametric statistical learning method, outperformed the other methods. However, simple transformations in the feature space could linearize the problem, so that linear models could achieve similar performance as KRR at much lower computational costs. Especially ME, a physiologically inspired extension of linear regression represents a promising candidate for the next gener-ation of prosthetic devices.},

abstract = {Progress in myoelectric control technology has over the years been incremental, due in part to the alternating focus of the R{\&}D between control methodology and device hardware. The technology has over the past 50 years or so moved from single muscle control of a single prosthesis function to muscle group activity control of multifunction prostheses. Central to these changes have been developments in the means of extracting information from the myoelectric signal. This paper gives an overview of the myoelectric signal processing challenge, a brief look at the challenge from an historical perspective, the state-of-the-art in myoelectric signal processing for prosthesis control, and an indication of where this field is heading. The paper demonstrates that considerable progress has been made in providing clients with useful and reliable myoelectric communication channels, and that exciting work and developments are on the horizon. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Andrews This volume is one of the first cohesive treatments of the use of mathematics for studying interactions between various recognition environments. It brings together techniques previously scattered throughout the literature and provides a concise common notation that will facilitate the understanding and comparison of the many aspects of mathematical pattern recognition. The contents of this volume are divided into five interrelated subject areas: Feature Selection, Distribution Free Classification, Statistical Classification, Nonsupervised Learning, and Sequential Learning. Appendices describing specific aspects of feature selection and extensive reference and bibliographies are included. 1972 253 pp. Threshold Logic and its Applications by Saburo Muroga This is the first in-depth exposition of threshold logic and its applications using linear programming and integer programming as optimization tools. It presents threshold logic as a unified theory of conventional simple gates, threshold gates and their networks. This unified viewpoint explicitly reveals many important properties that were formerly concealed in the framework of conventional switching theory (based essentially on and, or and not gates). 1971 478 pp. Knowing and Guessing A Quantitative Study of Inference and Information By Satosi Watanabe This volume presents a coherent theoretical view of a field now split into different disciplines: philosophy, information science, cybernetics, psychology, electrical engineering, and physics. The target of investigation is the cognitive process of knowing and guessing. In contrast to traditional philosophy, the approach is quantitative rather than qualitative. The study is formal in the sense that the author is not interested in the contents of knowledge or the physiological mechanism of the process of knowing.},
