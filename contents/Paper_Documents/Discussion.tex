Two intuitive electrotactile feedback schemes were developed for a two DoF velocity-based virtual prosthesis, one spatially modulated and one amplitude modulated. The schemes were integrated in an easy implementable 16 pad electrode array and tested in combination with sequential proportional myoelectric control. Unique sensory feedback was provided for four levels of prosthetic states in single DoF's and for 16 prosthetic states representing combined DoF's. The objective was to investigate the usability of the developed feedback schemes when removing visual dependency.
