\section{Data Acquisition}

In order for a subject to be able to control the virtual prosthesis online, the prosthetic control system needed to be trained with previously acquired EMG signals. For EMG data acquisition the Myo Armband (MYB) from Thalmic labs was used, which contained eight dry stainless steel electrode pairs embedded on the inside of the armband. Furthermore, it could communicate wirelessly to external devices via a Bluetooth 4.0 unit, making it a highly practical recording device with minimum preparation time needed. However, it had a fixed sample rate of 200 Hz with the exclusive analogue filter being a 50 Hz notch filter, thus, making the EMG signals prone to aliasing. A study by Mendez et al. \cite{Mendez2017} showed, however, a similar mean classification accuracy of nine hand gestures in a LDA classifier, when comparing data acquired with electrodes that covered the entire EMG spectrum and MYB acquired data. This justified the use of the MYB and only a 10 Hz cut-off second order Butterworth high-pass filter was implemented digitally to remove low frequency artefacts. \\
To account for the delay until steady state motions was reached, it was desired to train the prosthetic control system with both transient and steady state EMG data from each movement \cite{Boschmann2013}. To archive this, the subjects was to follow a trapezoidal trajectory, where they controlled a cursor that moved horizontally with time in windows of 200 ms and vertically with EMG intensity. The recording was 11 seconds, where the trajectory had an incline/decline of two seconds and a plateau of five seconds, representing transient and steady state, respectively. The trajectory and cursor position was scaled relative to an initially recorded prolonged maximum voluntary contraction (pMVC) of 15 seconds, which was set to 1. Data was acquired from three recordings per movement, where the plateau was 40 $\percent$, 50 $\percent$ and 70 $\percent$ of the pMVC's, respectively. A last recording of 15 seconds rest was also performed.

\subsection{Feature extraction}
Features were extracted from the acquired EMG signals to expand the amount of information used to train the classifier in the prosthetic control system. Due to the risk of the EMG signals being aliased, features representing frequency content might lose fidelity. In a study by Donovan et al. \cite{Donovan2017}, the classification accuracy of space-domain features exploiting the relationship between EMG signals from neighbouring electrode pairs in the MYB were compared with the commonly used Hudgins features in a LDA classifier. Here, the use of space-domain features yielded a 5 $\percent$ higher accuracy than the Hudgins features with EMG data acquired from the MYB. It was therefore chosen to use the five non-redundant features derived by Donovan et al., along with the Hudgins feature Waveform Length to represent frequency content indirectly \cite{Hudgins1993}, resulting in a total of six features. Both offline and online features were extracted in windows of 200 ms with a 50 $\percent$ overlap to obtain quick update time, while preserving robust classification accuracy \cite{Menon2017}.
