Having completed the training of a feedback scheme its usability was evaluated through a evaluation test. \\
Before undergoing the test the subject was given a three minute familiarization period to get reacquainted with control familiarize with having to control the cursor while also focusing on perceiving the provided stimulation. \\
The evaluation test was similar to the evaluation test presented in \secref{sec:pa:subjectcontrol}. However, the cursor was not visualized, thus, the subject solely relied on sensory feedback, when moving to a targeted state. The evaluation test was performed two times consecutively.
