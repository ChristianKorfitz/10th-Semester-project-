\subsection{Closed-Loop Evaluation}

The subject had until this point trained the prosthetic control and sensory feedback separately. The motor function and sensory feedback was now combined in a closed-loop prosthetic system. During this final evaluation test the visual feedback regarding the position state was eliminated. The subject then had to rely on the sensory feedback to assess the position state. 

Before undergoing the test the subject was given a three minute training period to get reacquainted with the prosthetic control and to further train the understanding of the feedback scheme. 
The evaluation test was identical to the evaluation test with visual feedback presented in section \ref{sec:pa:subjectcontrol}, besides that the virtual prosthesis was not visualized. Thus, the subject had to solely rely on electrotactile feedback, when reaching a target. The evaluation test was performed two times consecutively.
