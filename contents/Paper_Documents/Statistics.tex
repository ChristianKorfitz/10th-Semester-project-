\subsection{Statistical Analyses}
The metrics extracted from the evaluation tests were number of reached targets, time spend per target and path efficiency. Paired comparisons were made between results from evaluation tests. Due to the low sample size, comparisons was made using non-parametric statistics. Wilcoxon signed rank test was applied as comparisons was made on related samples obtained from a two block study design. A significance level of 5 $\%$ was used.
