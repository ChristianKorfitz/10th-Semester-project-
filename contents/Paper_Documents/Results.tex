Due to yielding no significant difference (p > 0.05) between the two evaluation tests for both the spatial and amplitude feedback block, it was chosen to view these evaluation tests as one, by calculating the mean between the two tests in both blocks. Figure \ref{fig:pa:boxplot_results} shows box plots of the extracted metrics for the visual, spatial and amplitude feedback evaluation tests. Worth noting was that visual feedback still outperformed solely relying on electrotactile feedback both when spatially or amplitude modulated for the completion rate and time to reach a target metrics. When comparing the spatial and amplitude feedback tests, using amplitude feedback yielded a slightly higher completion rate (p = 0.044). This quantitative result was also supported by the subjective opinion of the subjects as 64 \% of the subjects favoured the amplitude feedback. However, all subjects struggled in choosing a favoured feedback scheme as they found both intuitive to understand. 

When observing the completion rate of the specific targets in figure \ref{fig:pa:hit_dist}, it can be derived that targets generally had a higher hit rate when using amplitude feedback compared to spatial (Mean completion rate with spatial feedback = 87 \% and amplitude = 93 \%). However, common for both feedback scheme was that the centred targets were more troublesome to reach (Mean completion rate for centred targets was 76 \% with spatial feedback and 88 \% with amplitude feedback; mean completion rate for peripheral targets was 93 \% with spatial feedback and 97 \% with amplitude feedback). A possible reason for this finding is that the subjects had to achieve complete rest to dwell inside these targets. In the peripheral targets, the subjects did not necessarily need to achieve complete rest, as they could continue performing a movement and still be on the boundary of the target. Furthermore, combined DoF targets generally had a lower completion rate for the spatial feedback scheme (Mean completion rate for single DoF targets was 90 \% with spatial feedback and 93 \% with amplitude feedback; mean completion rate for combined DoF targets was 85 \% with spatial feedback and 93 \% with amplitude feedback). This could indicate that the sensory feedback regarding combined prosthetic states in the spatial feedback scheme was harder to interpret than in the amplitude feedback scheme.
