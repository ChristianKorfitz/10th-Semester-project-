\section{State of Art in Electrotactile Feedback}

As presented in \secref{E-stim} electrotactile stimulation offers a series of interesting properties which can be drawn upon when conveying highly complex information. Therefore, the state of art methods using electrotactile sensory feedback in the current literature has been reviewed and will presented to ensure that the new derived feedback schemes extends recent evidence. 

Multiple studies have investigated the use of electrotactile feedback regarding both how distinguishable sensations are evoked and how to convey sensory feedback in different coding schemes for improving myoelectric prosthetic control \cite{Stephens-Fripp2018}. 
In 2015 Shi and Shen \cite{Shi2015} investigated how subjects would perceive the effects of varying amplitude, frequency and pulse width of an electrical stimulation in various combinations. Results showed that appropriate sensations from electrical stimulation would be achieved by varying amplitude from 0.2 mA to 3 mA, pulse width from 0.2 ms to 20 ms and frequency from 45 Hz to 70 Hz. Furthermore, varying these ranges properly would make it possible to have proportionally increased grades felt by the subject. Additionally, the authors stated the importance of electrode size as stimulation through to big or to small diameters of these could result in sensations of pain or discomfort. \cite{Shi2015} \\         
Several studies \cite{Jorgovanovic2014,Isakovic2016,Xu2016,Pamungkas2015} using electrical stimulation has investigated its use in conveying grasping force/pressure feedback. Jorgovanovic et al.\cite{Jorgovanovic2014} investigated user's recognition of grip strength, in controlling a joystick controlled robotic hand, through varying the pulse width and keeping the frequency and intensity constant at 100 Hz and 3 mA, respectively. Results showed that providing electrotactile feedback improved the user's ability to move objects with the robotic hand. \cite{Jorgovanovic2014} Similar result were found by Isakovic et al. \cite{Isakovic2016}, who also showed that electrotactile feedback supported a faster learning than no feedback in grasp force control, and that electrotactile feedback might facilitate short-term learning. \\ 
A study by Xu et al. \cite{Xu2016} tested and evaluated different types of pressure and slip information feedback through electrotactile stimulation and compared this to visual feedback and no feedback. The study recruited 12 subjects, 6 able bodied, and provided electrotactile feedback by keeping the intensity and frequency constant and then varying the pulse width between 0 $\mu s$ and 500 $\mu s$ indicating changes in grasp force. In this case visual feedback was found to outperform electrotactile feedback. \cite{Xu2016} \\
Pamumgkas et al.\cite{Pamungkas2015} also tested the use of electrotactile feedback to convey information from pressure sensors located in a robotic had. There setup used six feedback channels corresponding to a pressure sensor in each of the fingers and one in the palm. Pressure information in the sensors were giving in three discretized frequency levels of 100 Hz, 60 Hz and 30 Hz for the fingers and 20 Hz for the palm. Reported results stated that the subject's learned how to appropriately use the feedback when picking up objects of various sizes. Furthermore, the subjects reported that the preferred having electrotactile feedback accompanied by visual feedback opposed to only having visual feedback. \cite{Pamungkas2015} 
The purpose of restoring the sensation that would be experienced by touch of the skin has also been pursued in more elaborate efforts through artificial skin. Here, a grid of 64 pressure sensors were used to translate information of touch into 32 electrotactile electrodes on the subject's arm. \cite{Hartmann2014,Franceschi2015}  \\
The use of electrotactile feedback has proven useful in cases of restoring the haptic feedback through pressure sensors on a prosthetic hand or by the touch on artificial skin. However, the possibilities of electrotactile feedback has also been investigated in case of improving prosthetic control. In 2016, Strbac et al. \cite{Strbac2016} presented novel electrotactile feedback stimulation system, which could be used the convey information on the state of a multi-DoF prosthesis. The system comprised of four different dynamic stimulation patters communicating the states of four different DoF's through a 16 multi-pad array electrode, possibly restoring both proprioception and force. The state of the three of the DoF's were communicated by altering the electrodes activated in patterned fashion and the fourth DoF by modulating the stimulation frequency. Tests of the stimulation design showed that six amputees were able to recognize the four DoF's with an average accuracy of 86\percent.  \cite{Strbac2016}
