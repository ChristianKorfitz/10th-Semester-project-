\section{Electromyography}

The control of a myoelectric prosthesis is based on recorded myoelectric signals. \cite{Geethanjali2016}  Enabling the use of myoelectric signals for control of functional prosthetics requires a theoretical background knowledge of the signals origin and how it can be acquired. The following section will describe myoelectric signal and how they are recorded through the method of electromyography.
