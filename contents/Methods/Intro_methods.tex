Applying the knowledge acquired regarding myoelectric prosthetic control and feedback stimulation, the following section will document the implementation of the two feedback configurations, and the remaining requirements needed to develop a closed-loop system. The methods chapter will contain sections documenting the implementation of study design, spatial configuration, amplitude configuration, control system and validation of control, data acquisition, data processing, feedback configuration training, feedback configuration evaluation, and statistical methods.
