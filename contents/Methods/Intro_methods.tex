Applying the knowledge acquired regarding myoelectric prosthetic control and feedback stimulation, the following section will document the implementation of the two novel feedback configurations, and the remaining requirements needed to test the usability of these in a closed-loop system. The methods chapter will contain sections documenting the implementation of study design, feedback configurations, data acquisition, data processing, fitting of prosthetic control system, validation of subjects' control abilities, feedback configuration training, feedback configuration evaluation and statistical analyses.
