Extending the knowledge acquired involving myoelectric prosthetic control, feedback stimulation and the desire among prosthetic users for prostheses to incorporate proprioceptive feedback, the following section will document the implementation of the two feedback configurations, as well as the rest of the developed closed loop system. The methods chapter will present the following sections documenting the implementation of: study design, data acquisition, data processing, control system and validation of control, spatial configuration, amplitude configuration, configuration training, performance test and statistical methods.
