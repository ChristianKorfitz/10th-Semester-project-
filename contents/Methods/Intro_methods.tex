Applying the knowledge acquired regarding myoelectric prosthetic control and tactile feedback, the following sections will document the implementation of the two novel feedback configurations, and the remaining requirements needed to test the usability of these in a closed-loop system. The methods chapter will contain sections documenting the implementation of study design, feedback configurations, a simulated virtual prosthesis, data acquisition, data processing, fitting of prosthetic control system, validation of subjects' control abilities, determination of sensory threshold levels, feedback configuration training and feedback configuration evaluation.
