\section{The Prosthetic Control System}

Having extracted features from the three EMG datasets of one movement for each of the four movements, the control system could be build in order to achieve real-time recognition of movements. The following sections will explain the implementation of the control system and how the achieved level of control was assessed for each subject. 

\subsection{Building the Control System} 

The implementation of the control system was divided into two parts. To achieve recognition of performed movement a classifier was trained, however this only produces a recognition of a movement and does not reflect the intensity of which the movement is being performed with. Therefore, following the recognition of performed movement a linear regression model was implemented to achieve proportional control.
