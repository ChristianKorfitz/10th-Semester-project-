\section{Data Processing}
The following sections will cover which filtering, segmentation and feature extraction that was decided to implement, based on the background information laid out in \secref{sec:BG:dataProcessing}. 

\subsection{Filtering}
Due to the EMG-bandwidth being 10-500 Hz and the interest of removing low-frequency artefact noise, a $2^{nd}$ order butterworth high-pass filter with a cut-off at 10 Hz was implemented. The order of the filter was chosen, as fast update time was highly desired in the online prosthetic control, and a higher order might have slowed the update due to a longer computation time. The choice of implementing a butterworth filter was due to the wanting of no phase shift inside the EMG bandwidth, as this might have distorted the fidelity of some of the extracted features. 

\subsection{Feature Extraction}



\begin{equation} \label{eq:MAV}
MAV_i=\frac{\sum\limits_{n=1}^{ws}|x_i[n]|}{ws}
\end{equation}



\begin{equation} \label{eq:MMAV}
MMAV=\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{8}MAV_i}{8}
\end{equation}



\begin{equation} \label{eq:SMAV}
SMAV_i=\frac{MAV_i}{MMAV}
\end{equation}



\begin{equation} \label{eq:CC}
CC_i=\frac{\sum\limits_{n=1}^{ws}X_i[n]X_{i+1}[n]}{ws}
\end{equation}



\begin{equation} \label{eq:MADN}
MADN_i=\frac{\sum\limits_{n=1}^{ws}|X_i[n]-X_{i+1}[n]|}{ws}
\end{equation}



\begin{equation} \label{eq:MADR}
MADR_i=\frac{\sum\limits_{n=1}^{ws}|x_i[n]-x_{i+1}[n]|}{ws}
\end{equation}



\begin{equation} \label{eq:MMADR}
SMADR_i=\frac{MADR_i}{MMAV}
\end{equation}



\begin{equation} \label{eq:WL}
WL_i=\sum\limits_{n=1}^{N-1}|x_{i+1}[n]-x_i[n]|
\end{equation}
