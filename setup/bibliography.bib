abstract = {—In recent years the number of active controllable joints in electrically powered hand-prostheses has increased significantly. However, the control strategies for these devices in current clinical use are inadequate as they require separate and sequential control of each degree of freedom (DoF). In this study we systematically compare linear and non-linear regression techniques for an independent, simultaneous and proportional myoelectric control of wrist movements with two DoF. These techniques include linear regression (LR), mixture of linear experts (ME), multilayer-perceptron (MLP) and kernel ridge regression (KRR). They are investigated offline with electro-myographic (EMG) signals acquired from ten able-bodied sub-jects and one person with congenital upper limb deficiency. The control accuracy is reported as a function of the number of electrodes and the amount and diversity of training data providing guidance for the requirements in clinical practice The results showed that KRR, a non-parametric statistical learning method, outperformed the other methods. However, simple transformations in the feature space could linearize the problem, so that linear models could achieve similar performance as KRR at much lower computational costs. Especially ME, a physiologically inspired extension of linear regression represents a promising candidate for the next gener-ation of prosthetic devices.},

abstract = {This review presents an analytical and comparative survey of upper limb prosthesis acceptance and abandonment as documented over the past 25 years, detailing areas of consumer dissatisfaction and ongoing technological advancements. English-language articles were identified in a search of Ovid, PubMed, and ISI Web of Science (1980 until February 2006) for key words upper limb and prosthesis. Articles focused on upper limb prostheses and addressing: (i) Factors associated with abandonment; (ii) Rejection rates; (iii) Functional analyses and patterns of wear; and (iv) Consumer satisfaction, were extracted with the exclusion of those detailing tools for outcome measurement, case studies, and medical procedures. Approximately 200 articles were included in the review process with 40 providing rates of prosthesis rejection. Quantitative measures of population characteristics, study methodology, and prostheses in use were extracted from each article. Mean rejection rates of 45{\%} and 35{\%} were observed in the literature for body-powered and electric prostheses respectively in pediatric populations. Significantly lower rates of rejection for both body-powered (26{\%}) and electric (23{\%}) devices were observed in adult populations while the average incidence of non-wear was similar for pediatric (16{\%}) and adult (20{\%}) populations. Documented rates of rejection exhibit a wide range of variance, possibly due to the heterogeneous samples involved and methodological differences between studies. Future research should comprise of controlled, multifactor studies adopting standardized outcome measures in order to promote comprehensive understanding of the factors affecting prosthesis use and abandonment. An enhanced understanding of these factors is needed to optimize prescription practices, guide design efforts, and satiate demand for evidence-based measures of intervention.},

abstract = {Objective. The aim of the present work was to develop and test a flexible electrotactile stimulation system to provide real-time feedback to the prosthesis user. The system requirements were to accommodate the capabilities of advanced multi-DOF myoelectric hand prostheses and transmit the feedback variables (proprioception and force) using intuitive coding, with high resolution and after minimal training. Approach. We developed a fully-programmable and integrated electrotactile interface supporting time and space distributed stimulation over custom designed flexible array electrodes. The system implements low-level access to individual stimulation channels as well as a set of high-level mapping functions translating the state of a multi-DoF prosthesis (aperture, grasping force, wrist rotation) into a set of predefined dynamic stimulation profiles. The system was evaluated using discrimination tests employing spatial and frequency coding (10 able-bodied subjects) and dynamic patterns (10 able-bodied and 6 amputee subjects). The outcome measure was the success rate (SR) in discrimination. Main results. The more practical electrode with the common anode configuration performed similarly to the more usual concentric arrangement. The subjects could discriminate six spatial and four frequency levels with SR {\textgreater}90{\%} after a few minutes of training, whereas the performance significantly deteriorated for more levels. The dynamic patterns were intuitive for the subjects, although amputees showed lower SR than able-bodied individuals (86{\%} 10{\%} versus 99{\%} 3{\%}). Significance. The tests demonstrated that the system was easy to setup and apply. The design and resolution of the multipad electrode was evaluated. Importantly, the novel dynamic patterns, which were successfully tested, can be superimposed to transmit multiple feedback variables intuitively and simultaneously. This is especially relevant for closing the loop in modern multifunction prostheses. Therefore, the proposed system is convenient for practical applications and can be used to implement sensory perception training and/or closed-loop control of myoelectric prostheses, providing grasping force and proprioceptive feedback.},

abstract = {Any implant or prosthesis replacing a function or functions of an organ or group of organs should be biologically and sensorily integrated with the human body in order to increase their acceptance with their user. If this replacement is for a human hand, which is an important interface between humans and their environment, the acceptance issue and developing sensory-motor embodiment will be more challenging. Despite progress in prosthesis technologies, 50-60{\&}{\#}x0025; of hand amputees wear a prosthetic device. One primary reason for the rejection of the prosthetic hands is that there is no or negligibly small feedback or tactile sensation from the hand to the user, making the hands less functional. In fact, the loss of a hand means interrupting the closed-loop sensory feedback between the brain (motor control) and the hand (sensory feedback through the nerves). The lack of feedback requires significant cognitive efforts from the user in order to do basic gestures and daily activities. To this aim, recently, there has been significant development in the provision of sensory feedback from transradial prosthetic hands, to enable the user take part in the control loop and improve user embodiment. Sensory feedback to the hand users can be provided via invasive and noninvasive methods. The latter includes the use of temperature, vibration, mechanical pressure and skin stretching, electrotactile stimulation, phantom limb stimulation, audio feedback, and augmented reality. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the non-invasive methods, performs their critical evaluation, and presents challenges and opportunities associated with the non-invasive sensory feedback methods.},

abstract = {Introduction: The needs of individuals with upper limb amputation and congenital limb difference are not being fully met by current prostheses, evidenced by prosthesis rejection, non-wear, and reports of pain and challenging activities. Emerging technologies such as electrical stimulation for the restoration of sensation, implantable neural interfaces for improved prosthetic control, and dexterous sensorized robotic limbs have the potential to provide novel benefits, but pose additional risks. Prosthesis user perspectives on such benefits and risks can inform device development, clinical trial design, and regulatory benefit-risk assessments. Methods: In preparation for a survey of prosthesis user perspectives on relevant benefits and risks, we conducted pilot interviews with seven individuals with upper limb amputation or congenital limb difference. Interviews included questions about participants' typical daily experiences. Particular attention was paid to challenging activities or situations in which limitations were encountered. When limitations were relevant to novel prosthetic technologies, participants were asked about their perspectives on these technologies. Interviews were recorded and transcribed for content analysis and text mining. Results: Pain on the intact side and the side with amputation or limb difference was mentioned frequently. Precise control of hand or finger movements was also important, both during activities of daily living (ADLs) and when using computers or handheld electronics. Common desires for new technologies were lighter-weight devices, more comfortable device attachment, and more functionality for ADLs. Text mining confirmed the importance of using prosthesis to execute "small tasks," comfort of the myoelectric socket, and playing with children. Conclusion: The qualitative data collected in this study can be used to generate hypotheses to test in a planned survey. The most consistent theme was pain due to overuse syndrome, which resulted in concerns about current and future impact on quality of life and ability to work. Therefore, some risks may be acceptable to some prosthesis users to obtain a prosthesis with dexterous function, control, fluidity of use, and operation speed. Another consistent theme was the value to participants of feeling "whole," functionally, cosmetically or in interpersonal relationships. Future survey questions may therefore probe the value of sensory feedback in the context of a naturalfeeling limb or body schema. A more complete understanding of how novel technologies could address real user needs may inform implementation of new technologies and regulatory decision-making. (Figure Presented) .},

abstract = {Closed-loop control is important for amputees to manipulate myoelectric prostheses intuitively and dexterously. Tactile feedback can help amputees improve myoelectric control performance for grasping objects. To investigate the effects of different tactile feedback, we performed experiments on six amputees and six able-bodied subjects via electrotactile stimulation. Using a virtual environment, six kinds of objects with different weights and stiffnesses were used for grasping tasks. Five feedback conditions (no feedback, pressure feedback, slip feedback, pressure+slip feedback, and vision feedback) were considered. Nine evaluation indexes and three control objectives (rapidity, economy, and stability) were proposed. Under the five feedback conditions, our study investigated four issues: 1) three types of grasping-related failures; 2) four types of grasping-related time measures; 3) average grasping force; 4) standard deviation of the grasping force. Results indicate that: 1) slip feedback is better than pressure feedback; 2) pressure+slip feedback can improve grasping rapidity; 3) slip feedback significantly contributes to grasping economy and stability; and 4) pressure+slip feedback can perform as well as vision feedback.},

abstract = {Background: Pattern recognition (PR) based strategies for the control of myoelectric upper limb prostheses are generally evaluated through offline classification accuracy, which is an admittedly useful metric, but insufficient to discuss functional performance in real time. Existing functional tests are extensive to set up and most fail to provide a challenging, objective framework to assess the strategy performance in real time. Methods. Nine able-bodied and two amputee subjects gave informed consent and participated in the local Institutional Review Board approved study. We designed a two-dimensional target acquisition task, based on the principles of Fitts' law for human motor control. Subjects were prompted to steer a cursor from the screen center of into a series of subsequently appearing targets of different difficulties. Three cursor control systems were tested, corresponding to three electromyography-based prosthetic control strategies: 1) amplitude-based direct control (the clinical standard of care), 2) sequential PR control, and 3) simultaneous PR control, allowing for a concurrent activation of two degrees of freedom (DOF). We computed throughput (bits/second), path efficiency ({\%}), reaction time (second), and overshoot ({\%})) and used general linear models to assess significant differences between the strategies for each metric. Results: We validated the proposed methodology by achieving very high coefficients of determination for Fitts' law. Both PR strategies significantly outperformed direct control in two-DOF targets and were more intuitive to operate. In one-DOF targets, the simultaneous approach was the least precise. The direct control was efficient in one-DOF targets but cumbersome to operate in two-DOF targets through a switch-depended sequential cursor control. Conclusions: We designed a test, capable of comprehensively describing prosthetic control strategies in real time. When implemented on control subjects, the test was able to capture statistically significant differences (p {\textless} 0.05) in control strategies when considering throughputs, path efficiencies and reaction times. Of particular note, we found statistically significant (p {\textless} 0.01) improvements in throughputs and path efficiencies with simultaneous PR when compared to direct control or sequential PR. Amputees could readily achieve the task; however a limited number of subjects was tested and a statistical analysis was not performed with that population. {\textcopyright} 2014 Wurth and Hargrove; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Closing the control loop by providing somatosensory feedback to the user of a prosthesis is a well-known, long standing challenge in the field of prosthetics. Various approaches have been investigated for feedback restoration, ranging from direct neural stimulation to noninvasive sensory substitution methods. Although there are many studies presenting closed-loop systems, only a few of them objectively evaluated the closed-loop performance, mostly using vibrotactile stimulation. Importantly, the conclusions about the utility of the feedback were partly contradictory. The goal of the current study was to systematically investigate the capability of human subjects to control grasping force in closed loop using electrotactile feedback. We have developed a realistic experimental setup for virtual grasping, which operated in real time, included a set of real life objects, as well as a graphical and dynamical model of the prosthesis. We have used the setup to test 10 healthy, able bodied subjects to investigate the role of training, feedback and feedforward control, robustness of the closed loop, and the ability of the human subjects to generalize the control to previously “unseen” objects. Overall, the outcomes of this study are very optimistic with regard to the benefits of feedback and reveal various, practically relevant, aspects of closed-loop control.},

abstract = {To effectively replace the human hand, a prosthesis should seamlessly respond to user intentions but also convey sensory information back to the user. Restoration of sensory feedback is rated highly by the prosthesis users, and feedback is critical for grasping in able-bodied subjects. Nonetheless, the benefits of feedback in prosthetics are still debated. The lack of consensus is likely due to the complex nature of sensory feedback during prosthesis control, so that its effectiveness depends on multiple factors (e.g., task complexity, user learning). We evaluated the impact of these factors with a longitudinal assessment in six amputee subjects, using a clinical setup (socket, embedded control) and a range of tasks (box and blocks, block turn, clothespin and cups relocation). To provide feedback, we have proposed a novel vibrotactile stimulation scheme capable of transmitting multiple variables from a multifunction prosthesis. The subjects wore a bracelet with four by two uniformly placed vibro-tactors providing information on contact, prosthesis state (active function), and grasping force. The subjects also completed a questionnaire for the subjective evaluation of the feedback. The tests demonstrated that feedback was beneficial only in the complex tasks (block turn, clothespin and cups relocation), and that the training had an important, task-dependent impact. In the clothespin relocation and block turn tasks, training allowed the subjects to establish successful feedforward control, and therefore, the feedback became redundant. In the cups relocation task, however, the subjects needed some training to learn how to properly exploit the feedback. The subjective evaluation of the feedback was consistently positive, regardless of the objective benefits. These results underline the multifaceted nature of closed-loop prosthesis control as, depending on the context, the same feedback interface can have different impact on performance. Finally, even if the closed-loop control does not improve the performance, it could be beneficial as it seems to improve the subjective experience. Therefore, in this study we demonstrate, for the first time, the relevance of an advanced, multi-variable feedback interface for dexterous, multi-functional prosthesis control in a clinically relevant setting.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The need of a sensory feedback system that would improve users' acceptance in prostheses is generally recognized. Feedback of hand opening and position are among the most important concerns of prosthetic users. To address the two concerns, this study investigated the human capability to identify pulse number and location when electrical stimulation applied on the forearm skin. The pulse number may potentially be used to encode the opening of prosthetic hands and stimulation location to encode finger position.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Ten able-bodied subjects participated in the study. Three electrodes were placed transversely across the ventral forearm spatially encoding three fingers (i.e., thumb, index, and middle finger). Five different pulse numbers (1, 4, 8, 12, and 20) encoded five levels of hand opening. The study consisted of three experiments. In the three experiments, each after a training session, the subjects were required to identify among: (a) five stimulation locations, (b) five pulse numbers, or (c) ten paired combinations of location and pulse number, respectively. The subjects' performance in the three identification tasks was evaluated.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The main results included: 1) the overall identification rate for stimulation location was 92.2 ± 6.2{\%}, while the success rate in two-site stimulation was lower than one-site stimulation; 2) the overall identification rate for pulse number was 90.8 ± 6.0{\%}, and the subjects showed different performance in identification of the five pulse numbers; 3) the overall identification rate decreased to 80.2 ± 11.7{\%} when the subjects were identifying paired parameters.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that the spatial (location) and temporal (pulse number) identification performance are promising in electrocutaneous stimulation on the forearm. The performance degraded when both parameters had to be identified likely due to increased cognitive load resulting from multiple tasks. Utilizing the proposed coding strategy in practical prosthetic hands remains to be investigated for clinical evaluation of its feasibility.},

abstract = {In closed loop control of grasping by hand prostheses, the feedback information sent to the user is usually the actual controlled variable, i.e., the grasp force. Although this choice is intuitive and logical, the force production is only the last step in the process of grasping. Therefore, this study evaluated the performance in controlling grasp strength using a hand prosthesis operated through a complete grasping sequence while varying the feedback variables (e.g., closing velocity, grasping force), which were provided to the user visually or through vibrotactile stimulation. The experiments were conducted on 13 volunteers who controlled the Otto Bock Sensor HandTM Speed prosthesis. Results showed that vibrotactile patterns were able to replace the visual feedback. Interestingly, the experiments demonstrated that direct force feedback was not essential for the control of grasping force. The subjects were indeed able to control the grip strength, predictively, by estimating the grasping force from the prosthesis velocity of closing. Therefore, grasping without explicit force feedback is not completely blind, contrary to what is usually assumed. In our study we analyzed grasping with a specific prosthetic device, but the outcomes are also applicable for other devices, with one or more degrees-of-freedom. The necessary condition is that the EMG directly and proportionally controls the velocity/grasp force of the hand, which is a common approach among EMG controlled prosthetic devices. The results provide important indications on the design of closed loop EMG controlled prosthetic systems.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A drawback of active prostheses is that they detach the subject from the produced forces, thereby preventing direct mechanical feedback. This can be compensated by providing somatosensory feedback to the user through mechanical or electrical stimulation, which in turn may improve the utility, sense of embodiment, and thereby increase the acceptance rate.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAPPROACH: In this study, we compared a novel approach to closing the loop, namely EMG feedback (emgFB), to classic force feedback (forceFB), using electrotactile interface in a realistic task setup. Eleven intact-bodied subjects and one transradial amputee performed a routine grasping task while receiving emgFB or forceFB. The two feedback types were delivered through the same electrotactile interface, using a mixed spatial/frequency coding to transmit 8 discrete levels of the feedback variable. In emgFB, the stimulation transmitted the amplitude of the processed myoelectric signal generated by the subject (prosthesis input), and in forceFB the generated grasping force (prosthesis output). The task comprised 150 trials of routine grasping at six forces, randomly presented in blocks of five trials (same force). Interquartile range and changes in the absolute error (AE) distribution (magnitude and dispersion) with respect to the target level were used to assess precision and overall performance, respectively.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN RESULTS: Relative to forceFB, emgFB significantly improved the precision of myoelectric commands (min/max of the significant levels) for 23{\%}/36{\%} as well as the precision of force control for 12{\%}/32{\%}, in intact-bodied subjects. Also, the magnitude and dispersion of the AE distribution were reduced. The results were similar in the amputee, showing considerable improvements.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSIGNIFICANCE: Using emgFB, the subjects therefore decreased the uncertainty of the forward pathway. Since there is a correspondence between the EMG and force, where the former anticipates the latter, the emgFB allowed for predictive control, as the subjects used the feedback to adjust the desired force even before the prosthesis contacted the object. In conclusion, the online emgFB was superior to the classic forceFB in realistic conditions that included electrotactile stimulation, limited feedback resolution (8 levels), cognitive processing delay, and time constraints (fast grasping).},

abstract = {Dexterous hand movement is possible due to closed loop control dependent on efferent motor output and afferent sensory feedback. This control strategy is significantly altered in those with upper limb amputation as sensations of touch and movement are inherently lost. For upper limb prosthetic users, the absence of sensory feedback impedes efficient use of the prosthesis and is highlighted as a major factor contributing to user rejection of myoelectric prostheses. Numerous sensory feedback systems have been proposed in literature to address this gap in prosthetic control; however, these systems have yet to be implemented for long term use. Methodologies for communicating prosthetic grasp and touch information are reviewed, including discussion of selected designs and test results. With a focus on clinical and translational challenges, this review highlights and compares techniques employed to provide amputees with sensory feedback. Additionally, promising future directions are discussed and highlighted.},

Recently, researchers have focused on exploiting the new possibilities offered by advancements in prosthetic technology. Alternatively, researchers could focus on prosthesis acceptance by developing functional requirements based on activities users are likely to perform. In this article, we describe the process of determining such requirements and then the application of these requirements to evaluating the state of the art in myoelectric forearm prosthesis research. As part of a needs assessment, a workshop was organized involving clinicians (representing end users), academics, and engineers. The resulting needs included an increased number of functions, lower reaction and execution times, and intuitiveness of both control and feedback systems. Reviewing the state of the art of research in the main prosthetic subsystems (electromyographic [EMG] sensing, control, and feedback) showed that modern research prototypes only partly fulfill the requirements. We found that focus should be on validating EMG-sensing results with patients, improving simultaneous control of wrist movements and grasps, deriving optimal parameters for force and position feedback, and taking into account the psychophysical aspects of feedback, such as intensity perception and spatial acuity.},

This study assessed the effect of a set of selected stimulation parameters on the sensations evoked by single- or dual-channel electrocutaneous stimulation. The investigated parameters included the stimulation site, the number of pulses, the number of stimulating channels (single- vs dual-channel), and the interleaved time between two channels. The modality, quality, location, and magnitude of the sensations were evaluated when the stimulations were applied on the forearm skin in 16 nondisabled subjects. Tactile perception was found to be induced more easily on the median and ulnar aspect than the dorsal and radial aspect of the forearm. Stimulation site significantly affected the magnitude of the sensation (p {\textless} 0.01). Dual-channel stimulation significantly increased the sensation magnitude (p {\textless} 0.05) only when the two electrodes were positioned closely. Moreover, a higher number of pulses evoked a movement perception more frequently and the interleaved time showed no significant effect on the magnitude of the sensation. The findings are expected to be useful for sensory substitution and augmentation applications. The results may also help improve users' acceptance of hand prostheses.},

Objective measures (proprioceptive drift) and subjective measures (survey answers) were used to assess prosthesis embodiment.

To equip prosthetic hand users with touch sensing and tactile feedback, researchers have been experimenting with various types of force and/or tactile sensors together with various methods for delivering the tactile information to the brain. Although some success has been achieved recently with force sensors and implanted electrodes, these systems are expensive, surgically invasive and can represent an infection risk where cables emerge through the skin. Also, non-invasive tactile feedback methods involving temperature, vibrations or electro-mechanical force feedbacks, can be somewhat awkward and ineffective due to being cumbersome or unable to deliver appropriate sensations. To address some of these issues we have been developing an electro-tactile feedback system for prosthetic hands. Our proposed system is comprised of force sensors that can be placed almost anywhere on a prosthetic hand, and TENS electrodes that can be placed on the wearer's arm. Our system is inexpensive, multi-channel and easily fitted to existing prosthetic hands. Experimental results are provided that show how this form of tactile feedback can enable a user to feel various objects touched or gripped with a robotic humanoid hand. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2011.},

abstract = {Aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of electrotactile feedback in closed loop training of force control during the routine grasping task. The feedback was provided using an array electrode and a simple six-level spatial coding, and the experiment was conducted in three amputee subjects. The psychometric tests confirmed that the subjects could perceive and interpret the electrotactile feedback with a high success rate. The subjects performed the routine grasping task comprising 4 blocks of 60 grasping trials. In each trial, the subjects employed feedforward control to close the hand and produce the desired grasping force (four levels). First (baseline) and the last (validation) session were performed in open loop, while the second and the third session (training) included electrotactile feedback. The obtained results confirmed that using the feedback improved the accuracy and precision of the force control. In addition, the subjects performed significantly better in the validation vs. baseline session, therefore suggesting that electrotactile feedback can be used for learning and training of myoelectric control.},
