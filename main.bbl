    \field{abstract}{%
    Dexterous hand movement is possible due to closed loop control dependent on
  efferent motor output and afferent sensory feedback. This control strategy is
  significantly altered in those with upper limb amputation as sensations of
  touch and movement are inherently lost. For upper limb prosthetic users, the
  absence of sensory feedback impedes efficient use of the prosthesis and is
  highlighted as a major factor contributing to user rejection of myoelectric
  prostheses. Numerous sensory feedback systems have been proposed in
  literature to address this gap in prosthetic control; however, these systems
  have yet to be implemented for long term use. Methodologies for communicating
  prosthetic grasp and touch information are reviewed, including discussion of
  selected designs and test results. With a focus on clinical and translational
  challenges, this review highlights and compares techniques employed to
  provide amputees with sensory feedback. Additionally, promising future
  directions are discussed and highlighted.%

    This review presents an analytical and comparative survey of upper limb
  prosthesis acceptance and abandonment as documented over the past 25 years,
  detailing areas of consumer dissatisfaction and ongoing technological
  advancements. English-language articles were identified in a search of Ovid,
  PubMed, and ISI Web of Science (1980 until February 2006) for key words upper
  limb and prosthesis. Articles focused on upper limb prostheses and
  addressing: (i) Factors associated with abandonment; (ii) Rejection rates;
  (iii) Functional analyses and patterns of wear; and (iv) Consumer
  satisfaction, were extracted with the exclusion of those detailing tools for
  outcome measurement, case studies, and medical procedures. Approximately 200
  articles were included in the review process with 40 providing rates of
  prosthesis rejection. Quantitative measures of population characteristics,
  study methodology, and prostheses in use were extracted from each article.
  Mean rejection rates of 45{\%} and 35{\%} were observed in the literature for
  body-powered and electric prostheses respectively in pediatric populations.
  Significantly lower rates of rejection for both body-powered (26{\%}) and
  electric (23{\%}) devices were observed in adult populations while the
  average incidence of non-wear was similar for pediatric (16{\%}) and adult
  (20{\%}) populations. Documented rates of rejection exhibit a wide range of
  variance, possibly due to the heterogeneous samples involved and
  methodological differences between studies. Future research should comprise
  of controlled, multifactor studies adopting standardized outcome measures in
  order to promote comprehensive understanding of the factors affecting
  prosthesis use and abandonment. An enhanced understanding of these factors is
  needed to optimize prescription practices, guide design efforts, and satiate
  demand for evidence-based measures of intervention.%

    User acceptance of myoelectric forearm prostheses is currently low. Awkward
  control, lack of feedback, and difficult training are cited as primary
  reasons. Recently, researchers have focused on exploiting the new
  possibilities offered by advancements in prosthetic technology.
  Alternatively, researchers could focus on prosthesis acceptance by developing
  functional requirements based on activities users are likely to perform. In
  this article, we describe the process of determining such requirements and
  then the application of these requirements to evaluating the state of the art
  in myoelectric forearm prosthesis research. As part of a needs assessment, a
  workshop was organized involving clinicians (representing end users),
  academics, and engineers. The resulting needs included an increased number of
  functions, lower reaction and execution times, and intuitiveness of both
  control and feedback systems. Reviewing the state of the art of research in
  the main prosthetic subsystems (electromyographic [EMG] sensing, control, and
  feedback) showed that modern research prototypes only partly fulfill the
  requirements. We found that focus should be on validating EMG-sensing results
  with patients, improving simultaneous control of wrist movements and grasps,
  deriving optimal parameters for force and position feedback, and taking into
  account the psychophysical aspects of feedback, such as intensity perception
  and spatial acuity.%

    Without the sense of touch, amputees with prosthetic hands can have
  difficulty holding and manipulating objects, especially when a task requires
  some degree of skill and tactile feedback to perform. To equip prosthetic
  hand users with touch sensing and tactile feedback, researchers have been
  experimenting with various types of force and/or tactile sensors together
  with various methods for delivering the tactile information to the brain.
  Although some success has been achieved recently with force sensors and
  implanted electrodes, these systems are expensive, surgically invasive and
  can represent an infection risk where cables emerge through the skin. Also,
  non-invasive tactile feedback methods involving temperature, vibrations or
  electro-mechanical force feedbacks, can be somewhat awkward and ineffective
  due to being cumbersome or unable to deliver appropriate sensations. To
  address some of these issues we have been developing an electro-tactile
  feedback system for prosthetic hands. Our proposed system is comprised of
  force sensors that can be placed almost anywhere on a prosthetic hand, and
  TENS electrodes that can be placed on the wearer's arm. Our system is
  inexpensive, multi-channel and easily fitted to existing prosthetic hands.
  Experimental results are provided that show how this form of tactile feedback
  can enable a user to feel various objects touched or gripped with a robotic
  humanoid hand. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2011.%

    Any implant or prosthesis replacing a function or functions of an organ or
  group of organs should be biologically and sensorily integrated with the
  human body in order to increase their acceptance with their user. If this
  replacement is for a human hand, which is an important interface between
  humans and their environment, the acceptance issue and developing
  sensory-motor embodiment will be more challenging. Despite progress in
  prosthesis technologies, 50-60{\&}{\#}x0025; of hand amputees wear a
  prosthetic device. One primary reason for the rejection of the prosthetic
  hands is that there is no or negligibly small feedback or tactile sensation
  from the hand to the user, making the hands less functional. In fact, the
  loss of a hand means interrupting the closed-loop sensory feedback between
  the brain (motor control) and the hand (sensory feedback through the nerves).
  The lack of feedback requires significant cognitive efforts from the user in
  order to do basic gestures and daily activities. To this aim, recently, there
  has been significant development in the provision of sensory feedback from
  transradial prosthetic hands, to enable the user take part in the control
  loop and improve user embodiment. Sensory feedback to the hand users can be
  provided via invasive and noninvasive methods. The latter includes the use of
  temperature, vibration, mechanical pressure and skin stretching,
  electrotactile stimulation, phantom limb stimulation, audio feedback, and
  augmented reality. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the
  non-invasive methods, performs their critical evaluation, and presents
  challenges and opportunities associated with the non-invasive sensory
  feedback methods.%

    Closed-loop control is important for amputees to manipulate myoelectric
  prostheses intuitively and dexterously. Tactile feedback can help amputees
  improve myoelectric control performance for grasping objects. To investigate
  the effects of different tactile feedback, we performed experiments on six
  amputees and six able-bodied subjects via electrotactile stimulation. Using a
  virtual environment, six kinds of objects with different weights and
  stiffnesses were used for grasping tasks. Five feedback conditions (no
  feedback, pressure feedback, slip feedback, pressure+slip feedback, and
  vision feedback) were considered. Nine evaluation indexes and three control
  objectives (rapidity, economy, and stability) were proposed. Under the five
  feedback conditions, our study investigated four issues: 1) three types of
  grasping-related failures; 2) four types of grasping-related time measures;
  3) average grasping force; 4) standard deviation of the grasping force.
  Results indicate that: 1) slip feedback is better than pressure feedback; 2)
  pressure+slip feedback can improve grasping rapidity; 3) slip feedback
  significantly contributes to grasping economy and stability; and 4)
  pressure+slip feedback can perform as well as vision feedback.%

    Objective. The aim of the present work was to develop and test a flexible
  electrotactile stimulation system to provide real-time feedback to the
  prosthesis user. The system requirements were to accommodate the capabilities
  of advanced multi-DOF myoelectric hand prostheses and transmit the feedback
  variables (proprioception and force) using intuitive coding, with high
  resolution and after minimal training. Approach. We developed a
  fully-programmable and integrated electrotactile interface supporting time
  and space distributed stimulation over custom designed flexible array
  electrodes. The system implements low-level access to individual stimulation
  channels as well as a set of high-level mapping functions translating the
  state of a multi-DoF prosthesis (aperture, grasping force, wrist rotation)
  into a set of predefined dynamic stimulation profiles. The system was
  evaluated using discrimination tests employing spatial and frequency coding
  (10 able-bodied subjects) and dynamic patterns (10 able-bodied and 6 amputee
  subjects). The outcome measure was the success rate (SR) in discrimination.
  Main results. The more practical electrode with the common anode
  configuration performed similarly to the more usual concentric arrangement.
  The subjects could discriminate six spatial and four frequency levels with SR
  {\textgreater}90{\%} after a few minutes of training, whereas the performance
  significantly deteriorated for more levels. The dynamic patterns were
  intuitive for the subjects, although amputees showed lower SR than
  able-bodied individuals (86{\%} 10{\%} versus 99{\%} 3{\%}). Significance.
  The tests demonstrated that the system was easy to setup and apply. The
  design and resolution of the multipad electrode was evaluated. Importantly,
  the novel dynamic patterns, which were successfully tested, can be
  superimposed to transmit multiple feedback variables intuitively and
  simultaneously. This is especially relevant for closing the loop in modern
  multifunction prostheses. Therefore, the proposed system is convenient for
  practical applications and can be used to implement sensory perception
  training and/or closed-loop control of myoelectric prostheses, providing
  grasping force and proprioceptive feedback.%

    Few studies are available in the literature on the sensations artificially
  created by dual-channel electrocutaneous stimulation. This study assessed the
  effect of a set of selected stimulation parameters on the sensations evoked
  by single- or dual-channel electrocutaneous stimulation. The investigated
  parameters included the stimulation site, the number of pulses, the number of
  stimulating channels (single- vs dual-channel), and the interleaved time
  between two channels. The modality, quality, location, and magnitude of the
  sensations were evaluated when the stimulations were applied on the forearm
  skin in 16 nondisabled subjects. Tactile perception was found to be induced
  more easily on the median and ulnar aspect than the dorsal and radial aspect
  of the forearm. Stimulation site significantly affected the magnitude of the
  sensation (p {\textless} 0.01). Dual-channel stimulation significantly
  increased the sensation magnitude (p {\textless} 0.05) only when the two
  electrodes were positioned closely. Moreover, a higher number of pulses
  evoked a movement perception more frequently and the interleaved time showed
  no significant effect on the magnitude of the sensation. The findings are
  expected to be useful for sensory substitution and augmentation applications.
  The results may also help improve users' acceptance of hand prostheses.%

    In closed loop control of grasping by hand prostheses, the feedback
  information sent to the user is usually the actual controlled variable, i.e.,
  the grasp force. Although this choice is intuitive and logical, the force
  production is only the last step in the process of grasping. Therefore, this
  study evaluated the performance in controlling grasp strength using a hand
  prosthesis operated through a complete grasping sequence while varying the
  feedback variables (e.g., closing velocity, grasping force), which were
  provided to the user visually or through vibrotactile stimulation. The
  experiments were conducted on 13 volunteers who controlled the Otto Bock
  Sensor HandTM Speed prosthesis. Results showed that vibrotactile patterns
  were able to replace the visual feedback. Interestingly, the experiments
  demonstrated that direct force feedback was not essential for the control of
  grasping force. The subjects were indeed able to control the grip strength,
  predictively, by estimating the grasping force from the prosthesis velocity
  of closing. Therefore, grasping without explicit force feedback is not
  completely blind, contrary to what is usually assumed. In our study we
  analyzed grasping with a specific prosthetic device, but the outcomes are
  also applicable for other devices, with one or more degrees-of-freedom. The
  necessary condition is that the EMG directly and proportionally controls the
  velocity/grasp force of the hand, which is a common approach among EMG
  controlled prosthetic devices. The results provide important indications on
  the design of closed loop EMG controlled prosthetic systems.%

    Lack of haptic feedback in prostheses is proving to be the bottleneck in
  the field. Closed loop prostheses should fill the gap for amputees to
  experience exteroceptive (environmental pressure) or proprioceptive (proper
  state or joint angles) by means of different sensory feedback. Detailed work
  is being done on the development of electrotactile and vi-brotactile
  stimulation system. The objective of this research is to generate
  vibrotactile feedback on a residual arm of an amputee. With this research, it
  is an endeavor for amputees to possess cognitive response while holding
  something amid environmental interactions with the help of convenient
  methodology and with suitable components in hand. To make this design
  pertinent to the objective, we have used coin shaped vibration motors,
  0.5-inch diameter circular FSR provide haptic feedback from the tip of the
  finger. 3D printed prosthetic hand proved to be the best remedy for lowering
  the cost. The research was conducted on 6 healthy subjects and one amputee.
  Experimental results showed the effectiveness of proposed approach.%

    The present research moves in the direction of enabling a bidirectional
  communication between the subject brain and the prosthetic limb, by providing
  the prosthesis with an artificial cutaneous sensing through an electronic
  skin. In this preliminary study, the skin response to the applied mechanical
  stimuli is conveyed to the human subject using electrotactile stimulation.
  Experimental tests on two healthy subjects show that a short training through
  reinforced learning increased considerably the success rate in the
  identification of the impact location. This preliminary study demonstrates
  the feasibility of communicating the tactile information from the electronic
  skin to the human subject using multichannel electrocutaneous stimulation.
  The result is promising since it implies that it might be possible to achieve
  the embodiment of the artificial skin into the body scheme of the human
  subject, relying on the brain ability to successfully process the artificial
  tactile information.%

    This research is motivated by the need of integrating cutaneous sensing
  into a prosthetic device, enabling a bidirectional communication between the
  amputee and the prosthetic limb. An electronic skin based on piezoelectric
  polymer sensors transduces mechanical contact into electrical response which
  is conveyed to the human subject by electrotactile stimulation. Rectangular
  electrode arrays are placed on each patient's forearm and experiments are
  conducted on five different subjects to determine how well the orientation,
  position and direction of single lines are recognized. Overall, subjects
  discriminate the different touch modalities with acceptable success rates. In
  particular, the direction is identified at best and longitudinal lines on the
  patient's skin are recognized with the highest success rates. These
  preliminary results assess the feasibility of the artificial skin -

    We evaluated real-time myoelectric pattern recognition control of a virtual
  arm by transradial amputees. Five unilateral patients performed 10 wrist and
  hand movements using their amputated and intact arms. In order to demonstrate
  the value of information from intrinsic hand muscles, this data was included
  in EMG recordings from the intact arm. With both arms, motions were selected
  in approximately 0.2 s on average, and completed in less than 1.25 s.
  Approximately 99{\%} of wrist movements were completed using either arm;
  however, the completion rate of hand movements was significantly lower for
  the amputated arm (53.9{\%} {\^{A}}± 14.2{\%}) than for the intact arm (
  69.4{\%} {\^{A}}± 13.1{\%}). For the amputated arm, average classification
  accuracy for only 6 movements-including a single hand grasp-was 93.1{\%}
  {\^{A}}± 4.1{\%}, compared to 84.4{\%} {\^{A}}± 7.2{\%} for all 10
  movements. Use of 6 optimally-placed electrodes only reduced this accuracy to
  91.5{\%} {\^{A}}± 4.9{\%}. These results suggest that muscles in the
  residual forearm produce sufficient myoelectric information for real-time
  wrist control, but not for performing multiple hand grasps. The outcomes of
  this study could aid the development of a practical multifunctional
  myoelectric prosthesis for transradial amputees, and suggest that increased
  EMG information-such as made available through targeted muscle
  reinnervation-could improve control of these prostheses .%

    One of the challenges facing prosthetic designers and engineers is to
  restore the missing sensory function inherit to hand amputation. Several
  different techniques can be employed to provide amputees with sensory
  feedback: sensory substitution methods where the recorded stimulus is not
  only transferred to the amputee, but also translated to a different modality
  (modality-matched feedback), which transfers the stimulus without translation
  and direct neural stimulation, which interacts directly with peripheral
  afferent nerves. This paper presents an overview of the principal works and
  devices employed to provide upper limb amputees with sensory feedback. The
  focus is on sensory substitution and modality matched feedback; the principal
  features, advantages and disadvantages of the different methods are
  presented.%

    Introduction: The needs of individuals with upper limb amputation and
  congenital limb difference are not being fully met by current prostheses,
  evidenced by prosthesis rejection, non-wear, and reports of pain and
  challenging activities. Emerging technologies such as electrical stimulation
  for the restoration of sensation, implantable neural interfaces for improved
  prosthetic control, and dexterous sensorized robotic limbs have the potential
  to provide novel benefits, but pose additional risks. Prosthesis user
  perspectives on such benefits and risks can inform device development,
  clinical trial design, and regulatory benefit-risk assessments. Methods: In
  preparation for a survey of prosthesis user perspectives on relevant benefits
  and risks, we conducted pilot interviews with seven individuals with upper
  limb amputation or congenital limb difference. Interviews included questions
  about participants' typical daily experiences. Particular attention was paid
  to challenging activities or situations in which limitations were
  encountered. When limitations were relevant to novel prosthetic technologies,
  participants were asked about their perspectives on these technologies.
  Interviews were recorded and transcribed for content analysis and text
  mining. Results: Pain on the intact side and the side with amputation or limb
  difference was mentioned frequently. Precise control of hand or finger
  movements was also important, both during activities of daily living (ADLs)
  and when using computers or handheld electronics. Common desires for new
  technologies were lighter-weight devices, more comfortable device attachment,
  and more functionality for ADLs. Text mining confirmed the importance of
  using prosthesis to execute "small tasks," comfort of the myoelectric socket,
  and playing with children. Conclusion: The qualitative data collected in this
  study can be used to generate hypotheses to test in a planned survey. The
  most consistent theme was pain due to overuse syndrome, which resulted in
  concerns about current and future impact on quality of life and ability to
  work. Therefore, some risks may be acceptable to some prosthesis users to
  obtain a prosthesis with dexterous function, control, fluidity of use, and
  operation speed. Another consistent theme was the value to participants of
  feeling "whole," functionally, cosmetically or in interpersonal
  relationships. Future survey questions may therefore probe the value of
  sensory feedback in the context of a naturalfeeling limb or body schema. A
  more complete understanding of how novel technologies could address real user
  needs may inform implementation of new technologies and regulatory
  decision-making. (Figure Presented) .%

  wearing a prosthetic limb, which is of great importance

    \field{abstract}{%
    Closing the control loop by providing somatosensory feedback to the user of
  a prosthesis is a well-known, long standing challenge in the field of
  prosthetics. Various approaches have been investigated for feedback
  restoration, ranging from direct neural stimulation to noninvasive sensory
  substitution methods. Although there are many studies presenting closed-loop
  systems, only a few of them objectively evaluated the closed-loop
  performance, mostly using vibrotactile stimulation. Importantly, the
  conclusions about the utility of the feedback were partly contradictory. The
  goal of the current study was to systematically investigate the capability of
  human subjects to control grasping force in closed loop using electrotactile
  feedback. We have developed a realistic experimental setup for virtual
  grasping, which operated in real time, included a set of real life objects,
  as well as a graphical and dynamical model of the prosthesis. We have used
  the setup to test 10 healthy, able bodied subjects to investigate the role of
  training, feedback and feedforward control, robustness of the closed loop,
  and the ability of the human subjects to generalize the control to previously
  “unseen” objects. Overall, the outcomes of this study are very optimistic
  with regard to the benefits of feedback and reveal various, practically
  relevant, aspects of closed-loop control.%

    Aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of electrotactile
  feedback in closed loop training of force control during the routine grasping
  task. The feedback was provided using an array electrode and a simple
  six-level spatial coding, and the experiment was conducted in three amputee
  subjects. The psychometric tests confirmed that the subjects could perceive
  and interpret the electrotactile feedback with a high success rate. The
  subjects performed the routine grasping task comprising 4 blocks of 60
  grasping trials. In each trial, the subjects employed feedforward control to
  close the hand and produce the desired grasping force (four levels). First
  (baseline) and the last (validation) session were performed in open loop,
  while the second and the third session (training) included electrotactile
  feedback. The obtained results confirmed that using the feedback improved the
  accuracy and precision of the force control. In addition, the subjects
  performed significantly better in the validation vs. baseline session,
  therefore suggesting that electrotactile feedback can be used for learning
  and training of myoelectric control.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    To effectively replace the human hand, a prosthesis should seamlessly
  respond to user intentions but also convey sensory information back to the
  user. Restoration of sensory feedback is rated highly by the prosthesis
  users, and feedback is critical for grasping in able-bodied subjects.
  Nonetheless, the benefits of feedback in prosthetics are still debated. The
  lack of consensus is likely due to the complex nature of sensory feedback
  during prosthesis control, so that its effectiveness depends on multiple
  factors (e.g., task complexity, user learning). We evaluated the impact of
  these factors with a longitudinal assessment in six amputee subjects, using a
  clinical setup (socket, embedded control) and a range of tasks (box and
  blocks, block turn, clothespin and cups relocation). To provide feedback, we
  have proposed a novel vibrotactile stimulation scheme capable of transmitting
  multiple variables from a multifunction prosthesis. The subjects wore a
  bracelet with four by two uniformly placed vibro-tactors providing
  information on contact, prosthesis state (active function), and grasping
  force. The subjects also completed a questionnaire for the subjective
  evaluation of the feedback. The tests demonstrated that feedback was
  beneficial only in the complex tasks (block turn, clothespin and cups
  relocation), and that the training had an important, task-dependent impact.
  In the clothespin relocation and block turn tasks, training allowed the
  subjects to establish successful feedforward control, and therefore, the
  feedback became redundant. In the cups relocation task, however, the subjects
  needed some training to learn how to properly exploit the feedback. The
  subjective evaluation of the feedback was consistently positive, regardless
  of the objective benefits. These results underline the multifaceted nature of
  closed-loop prosthesis control as, depending on the context, the same
  feedback interface can have different impact on performance. Finally, even if
  the closed-loop control does not improve the performance, it could be
  beneficial as it seems to improve the subjective experience. Therefore, in
  this study we demonstrate, for the first time, the relevance of an advanced,
  multi-variable feedback interface for dexterous, multi-functional prosthesis
  control in a clinically relevant setting.%

    An anthropomorphic underactuated prosthetic hand, endowed with position and
  force sensors and controlled by means of myoelectric commands, is used to
  perform experiments of hierarchical shared control. Three different
  hierarchical control strategies combined with a vibrotactile feedback system
  have been developed and tested by able-bodied subjects through grasping tasks
  used in activities of daily living (ADLs). The first goal is to find a good
  tradeoff between good grasping capabilities and low attention required by the
  user to complete grasping tasks, without addressing advanced algorithm for
  electromyographic processing. The second goal is to understand whether a
  vibrotactile feedback system is subjectively or objectively useful and how it
  changes users' performance. Experiments showed that users were able to
  successfully operate the device in the three control strategies, and that the
  grasp success increased with more interactive control. Practice has proven
  that when too much effort is required, subjects do not do their best,
  preferring, instead, a less-interactive control strategy. Moreover, the
  experiments showed that when grasping tasks are performed under visual
  control, the enhanced proprioception offered by a vibrotactile system is
  practically not exploited. Nevertheless, in subjective opinion, feedback
  seems to be quite important.%

    User feedback about grasping force or slip of objects is lacking in current
  myoelectric forearm prostheses, resulting in a high number of prosthesis
  abandonment, because a high level of concentration is required to hold an
  object. Several approaches to provide force feedback to the user via
  vibrotactile stimulation have been described in literature, but none of them
  have investigated the optimal stimulation parameters. This study describes an
  evaluation of three modulation techniques to provide force feedback.
  Furthermore, the same modulation techniques to provide slip feedback were
  evaluated, which has not been described before. The performance in virtual
  object holding tasks was significantly improved in most cases compared to the
  non-feedback situation, but at the cost of an increased task duration.%

    Feature extraction is a significant method to extract the useful
  information which is hidden in surface electromyography (EMG) signal and to
  remove the unwanted part and interferences. To be successful in
  classification of the EMG signal, selection of a feature vector ought to be
  carefully considered. However, numerous studies of the EMG signal
  classification have used a feature set that have contained a number of
  redundant features. In this study, most complete and up-to-date thirty-seven
  time domain and frequency domain features have been proposed to be studied
  their properties. The results, which were verified by scatter plot of
  features, statistical analysis and classifier, indicated that most time
  domain features are superfluity and redundancy. They can be grouped according
  to mathematical property and information into four main types: energy and
  complexity, frequency, prediction model, and time-dependence. On the other
  hand, all frequency domain features are calculated based on statistical
  parameters of EMG power spectral density. Its performance in class
  separability viewpoint is not suitable for EMG recognition system.
  Recommendation of features to avoid the usage of redundant features for
  classifier in EMG signal classification applications is also proposed in this
  study. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.%

     Abstract—In recent years, low-cost, low-power myoelectric control
  systems such as the Myo armband from Thalmic Labs have become available and
  unlocked tremendous possibilities for myoelectric controlled applications.
  However, due to the embedded system constraints, such sEMG control devices
  typically samples sEMG signals at a lower frequency. It is in doubt whether
  existing sEMG feature extraction methods are still valid on such
  low-resolution sEMG data. In addition, the feature extraction algorithms
  implemented on embedded devices must have low computational complexity in
  order to meet the real-time requirement. This paper aims to investigate
  effective features for low-resolution EMG pattern recognition. In particular,
  a set of novel computational efficient space-domain (SD) features (referred
  to as simple SD (SSD) features) have been developed to exploit the spatial
  relationships of sEMG signals recorded from the sensor array on the Myo
  armband. The proposed SSD feature set was evaluated with a linear
  discriminant analysis (LDA)-based classifier on a 9-gesture dataset. The
  experimental results indicate that using the SSD features increased the
  classification accuracy by 5{\%} compared to using Hudgins' time-domain
  features.%

    Introduction to Mathematical Techniques in Pattern Recognition by Harry C.
  Andrews This volume is one of the first cohesive treatments of the use of
  mathematics for studying interactions between various recognition
  environments. It brings together techniques previously scattered throughout
  the literature and provides a concise common notation that will facilitate
  the understanding and comparison of the many aspects of mathematical pattern
  recognition. The contents of this volume are divided into five interrelated
  subject areas: Feature Selection, Distribution Free Classification,
  Statistical Classification, Nonsupervised Learning, and Sequential Learning.
  Appendices describing specific aspects of feature selection and extensive
  reference and bibliographies are included. 1972 253 pp. Threshold Logic and

  programming as optimization tools. It presents threshold logic as a unified
  theory of conventional simple gates, threshold gates and their networks. This
  unified viewpoint explicitly reveals many important properties that were
  formerly concealed in the framework of conventional switching theory (based
  essentially on and, or and not gates). 1971 478 pp. Knowing and Guessing A
  Quantitative Study of Inference and Information By Satosi Watanabe This
  volume presents a coherent theoretical view of a field now split into
  different disciplines: philosophy, information science, cybernetics,
  psychology, electrical engineering, and physics. The target of investigation
  is the cognitive process of knowing and guessing. In contrast to traditional
  philosophy, the approach is quantitative rather than qualitative. The study
  is formal in the sense that the author is not interested in the contents of
  knowledge or the physiological mechanism of the process of knowing.%

    This paper represents an ongoing investigation of dexterous and natural
  control of upper extremity prostheses using the myoelectric signal (MES). The
  scheme described within uses pattern recognition to process four channels of
  MES, with the task of discriminating multiple classes of limb movement. The
  method does not require segmentation of the MES data, allowing a continuous
  stream of class decisions to be delivered to a prosthetic device. It is shown
  in this paper that, by exploiting the processing power inherent in current
  computing systems, substantial gains in classifier accuracy and response time
  are possible. Other important characteristics for prosthetic control systems
  are met as well. Due to the fact that the classifier learns the muscle
  activation patterns for each desired class for each individual, a natural
  control actuation results. The continuous decision stream allows complex
  sequences of manipulation involving multiple joints to be performed without
  interruption. Finally, minimal storage capacity is required, which is an
  important factor in embedded control systems.%

    This study describes a novel myoelectric control scheme that is capable of
  motion rejection. As an extension of the commonly used linear discriminant
  analysis (LDA), this system generates a confidence score for each decision,
  providing the ability to reject those with a score below a selected
  threshold. The thresholds are class-specific and affect only the rejection
  characteristics of the associated class. Furthermore, because the rejection
  stage is implemented using the outputs of the LDA, the active motion
  classification accuracy of the proposed system is shown to outperform that of
  the LDA for all values of rejection threshold. The proposed scheme was
  compared to a baseline LDA-based pattern recognition system using a real-time
  Fitts' law-based target acquisition task. The use of velocity-based
  myoelectric control using the rejection classifier is shown to obey Fitts'
  law, producing linear regression fittings with high coefficients of
  determination (R(2) {\textgreater} 0.943). Significantly higher (p
  {\textless} 0.001) throughput, path efficiency, and completion rates were
  observed with the rejection-capable system for both able-bodied and amputee
  subjects.%

    The recent introduction of novel multifunction hands as well as new control
  paradigms increase the demand for advanced prosthetic control systems. In
  this context, an unambiguous terminology and a good understanding of the
  nature of the control problem is important for efficient research and
  communication concerning the subject. Thus, one purpose of this paper is to
  suggest an unambiguous taxonomy, applicable to control systems for upper limb
  prostheses and also to prostheses in general. A functionally partitioned
  model of the prosthesis control problem is also presented along with the
  taxonomy. In the second half of the paper, the suggested taxonomy has been
  exploited in a comprehensive literature review on proportional myoelectric
  control of upper limb prostheses. The review revealed that the methods for
  system training have not matured at the same pace as the novel multifunction
  prostheses and more advanced intent interpretation methods. Few publications
  exist regarding the choice of training method and the composition of the
  training data set. In this context, the notion of outcome measures is
  essential. By definition, system training involves optimization, and the
  quality of the results depends heavily on the choice of appropriate
  optimization criteria. In order to further promote the development of
  proportional myoelectric control, these topics need to be addressed.%

    The functionality of upper limb prostheses can be improved by intuitive
  control strategies that use bioelectric signals measured at the stump level.
  One such strategy is the decoding of motor volition via myoelectric pattern
  recognition (MPR), which has shown promising results in controlled
  environments and more recently in clinical practice. Moreover, not much has
  been reported about daily life implementation and real-time accuracy of these
  decoding algorithms. This paper introduces an alternative approach in which
  MPR allows intuitive control of four different grips and open/close in a
  multifunctional prosthetic hand. We conducted a clinical proof-of-concept in
  activities of daily life by constructing a self-contained, MPR-controlled,
  transradial prosthetic system provided with a novel user interface meant to
  log errors during real-time operation. The system was used for five days by a
  unilateral dysmelia subject whose hand had never developed, and who
  nevertheless learned to generate patterns of myoelectric activity, reported
  as intuitive, for multi-functional prosthetic control. The subject was
  instructed to manually log errors when they occurred via the user interface
  mounted on the prosthesis. This allowed the collection of information about
  prosthesis usage and real-time classification accuracy. The assessment of
  capacity for myoelectric control test was used to compare the proposed
  approach to the conventional prosthetic control approach, direct control.
  Regarding the MPR approach, the subject reported a more intuitive control
  when selecting the different grips, but also a higher uncertainty during
  proportional continuous movements. This paper represents an alternative to
  the conventional use of MPR, and this alternative may be particularly
  suitable for a certain type of amputee patients. Moreover, it represents a
  further validation of MPR with dysmelia cases.%

    We assessed the ability of four transradial amputees to control a virtual
  prosthesis capable of nine classes of movement both before and after a
  two-week training period. Subjects attended eight one-on-one training
  sessions that focused on improving the consistency and distinguishability of
  their hand and wrist movements using visual biofeedback from a virtual
  prosthesis. The virtual environment facilitated the precise quantification of
  three prosthesis control measures. During a final evaluation, the subject
  population saw an average increase in movement completion percentage from
  70.8{\%} to 99.0{\%}, an average improvement in normalized movement
  completion time from 1.47 to 1.13, and an average increase in movement
  classifier accuracy from 77.5{\%} to 94.4{\%} (p{\textless}0.001).
  Additionally, all four subjects were reevaluated after eight elapsed hours
  without retraining the classifier, and all subjects demonstrated minimal
  decreases in performance. Our analysis of the underlying sources of
  improvement for each subject examined the sizes and separation of
  high-dimensional data clusters and revealed that each subject formed a unique

    Background: Pattern recognition (PR) based strategies for the control of
  myoelectric upper limb prostheses are generally evaluated through offline
  classification accuracy, which is an admittedly useful metric, but
  insufficient to discuss functional performance in real time. Existing
  functional tests are extensive to set up and most fail to provide a
  challenging, objective framework to assess the strategy performance in real
  time. Methods. Nine able-bodied and two amputee subjects gave informed
  consent and participated in the local Institutional Review Board approved
  study. We designed a two-dimensional target acquisition task, based on the
  principles of Fitts' law for human motor control. Subjects were prompted to
  steer a cursor from the screen center of into a series of subsequently
  appearing targets of different difficulties. Three cursor control systems
  were tested, corresponding to three electromyography-based prosthetic control
  strategies: 1) amplitude-based direct control (the clinical standard of
  care), 2) sequential PR control, and 3) simultaneous PR control, allowing for
  a concurrent activation of two degrees of freedom (DOF). We computed
  throughput (bits/second), path efficiency ({\%}), reaction time (second), and
  overshoot ({\%})) and used general linear models to assess significant
  differences between the strategies for each metric. Results: We validated the
  proposed methodology by achieving very high coefficients of determination for
  Fitts' law. Both PR strategies significantly outperformed direct control in
  two-DOF targets and were more intuitive to operate. In one-DOF targets, the
  simultaneous approach was the least precise. The direct control was efficient
  in one-DOF targets but cumbersome to operate in two-DOF targets through a
  switch-depended sequential cursor control. Conclusions: We designed a test,
  capable of comprehensively describing prosthetic control strategies in real
  time. When implemented on control subjects, the test was able to capture
  statistically significant differences (p {\textless} 0.05) in control
  strategies when considering throughputs, path efficiencies and reaction
  times. Of particular note, we found statistically significant (p {\textless}
  0.01) improvements in throughputs and path efficiencies with simultaneous PR
  when compared to direct control or sequential PR. Amputees could readily
  achieve the task; however a limited number of subjects was tested and a
  statistical analysis was not performed with that population. {\textcopyright}

    —In recent years the number of active controllable joints in electrically
  powered hand-prostheses has increased significantly. However, the control
  strategies for these devices in current clinical use are inadequate as they
  require separate and sequential control of each degree of freedom (DoF). In
  this study we systematically compare linear and non-linear regression
  techniques for an independent, simultaneous and proportional myoelectric
  control of wrist movements with two DoF. These techniques include linear
  regression (LR), mixture of linear experts (ME), multilayer-perceptron (MLP)
  and kernel ridge regression (KRR). They are investigated offline with
  electro-myographic (EMG) signals acquired from ten able-bodied sub-jects and
  one person with congenital upper limb deficiency. The control accuracy is
  reported as a function of the number of electrodes and the amount and
  diversity of training data providing guidance for the requirements in
  clinical practice The results showed that KRR, a non-parametric statistical
  learning method, outperformed the other methods. However, simple
  transformations in the feature space could linearize the problem, so that
  linear models could achieve similar performance as KRR at much lower
  computational costs. Especially ME, a physiologically inspired extension of
  linear regression represents a promising candidate for the next gener-ation
  of prosthetic devices.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    This paper presents two methods for the classification of six different
  hand motions based on the analysis of the transient state of surface
  multichannel electromyographic signals recorded from 10 normally limbed
  subjects. The signals were classified using the coefficients extracted from a
  discrete wavelet transform analysis. While the first method uses a feature
  vector based on the variance of the wavelet coefficients, the second analysis
  considers a PCA treatment focused on dimensionality reduction. These vectors
  were used to feed an artificial neural network. The first method was applied
  for both the transient and steady states obtaining an average classification
  accuracy of 89.43{\%} (SD 2.05{\%}) and 91.86{\%} (SD 3.17{\%}) respectively.
  The second method gave a classification accuracy of 92.58{\%} (SD 3.07{\%})
  for the transient state. This proves the existence of deterministic
  information within the transient state of the EMG signal and the possibility
  to classify different movements since the beginning of the muscle
  contraction.%
